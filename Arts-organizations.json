Our calendar is jam packed with activities, with the intention of having “something for everyone” and nobody gets left behind.\nYou will notice on our rides that we use a colour code system to differentiate the difficulty. To understand this better and to work out which level you are at please read our ability guide here:\nhttps://claphamcycleclub.com/[abilityguide/](https://claphamcycle.com/abilityguide/)\nWe now have over 190 registered members, with 3-4 rides every week, and with multiple trips abroad.\nIn 2019 we completed 256 events in total and for 2020 we aim to complete even more!\nJoin us, meet some new friends, and become a part of the fastest growing cycling community around.\n*Please read out Do's & Donts before attending any of our rides (link below)*\n*[http://www.meetup.com/Clapham-Cycle/pages/Clapham_Cycle_-_Do%27s_and_Don%27ts](http://www.meetup.com/Clapham-Cycle/pages/Clapham_Cycle_-_Do%27s_and_Don%27ts)*\n**Pace Groups**\nWe will never allow more than 10 people in a group, so we if have more than one leader we will split into two or three groups. We will then split the pace the best we can, the faster riders in group 1 and so fourth. So 1 leader equals 10 cyclists, this is why you will see wait-list for a while until another leader confirms.\n**RSVP Rules**\nOur rides are getting very popular, please only RSVP if you are serious about coming. There is nothing worse than having no-shows and then people on the wait list missing out. If you no-show 3 times without 24 hours cancellation notice you will be removed from the group.\n**Use Strava?**\nWe have our own club, please join!

This gives you an easy and convenient way to meet new people in a way that completely dissolves barriers. This is NOT speed dating and so you will be meeting both ladies and gentlemen in mixed groups. The intent is to create friendships.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits is that this tears down the walls of shyness. Many people have deep-seated anxiety when it comes to talking to people they don’t know. But when you push outside your comfort zones, this speedy connection opens up the door to allow you to easily communicate and work together with other members of the group.\n\nSpeed friending allows you to identify other people with common interests. The conversations that take place don’t have to be deep, profound or even scripted; simply discussing likes and dislikes may lead to future friendships. Often, people want to make new friends, but they aren’t quite sure how to go about it.

We have a great group of organisers with varied tastes and interests; which keeps our calendar filled with mainstream and more eclectic events.\nWith over **2,200 events** in the 10 years we've been going, the variety of shows we've seen is immense. We see a mixture of musicals, plays, opera, ballet, music, comedians and films and are always open to new suggestions! A calender of our events can be found here: [https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar](https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar)\n**There is a one-off joining fee of £2.50** to be a member of **up-in-the-cheap-seats**.

Obviously the price is not guaranteed especially if the show is popular or you wait a few days before booking.\n\n**Please update your RSVP to confirm that you are joining us.** The organiser will normally add a comment to the event page saying which seat they have purchased. This isn’t mandatory but helps others decide on their seat selection – it is always nice to be sat near or next to another member of the group! The group does not charge to attend individual events (just the one-off £2.50 joining fee). Therefore Meetup states that the event is free. This does not mean that your ticket is free - you will need to purchase this yourself.\n\nThe event host will post the meet up details a day or two before the show.\n\nWe usually meet outside the theatre or in one of the theatre's bars around 30 minutes before the show.\n\nIf there is an interval we will meet up again in the bar at the interval so we can all share our opinion of what we have enjoyed (or not!) so far.\n\nWe will also usually meet up afterwards for a brief chat about the show but sometimes (depending on how late it is and the day of the week), we may go on somewhere for a drink and a longer chat.\n\n**If you are unable to make an event, please change your RSVP** so that your host knows not to wait for you.  \n\nHope to see you at an event soon,\n**Your UITCS Oraganisers**\n\\*Please note, this group does generate a lot of email, but the good news is these settings are customisable, and can easily be changed by going to 'My Profile', then 'Emails' and 'Notifications'.","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":true,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"33123951","name":"Walking and Wine Women's Group","link":"https://www.meetup.com/walking-and-wine-womens-group","description":"A women's social group for over 40's based around Ealing/West London.\nWalking and wine are two of my favourite things along with good company, food and occasional gallery/film/theatre - events will reflect this.

It has never been.\n\nWe need developers to help save water and energy, and prolong the lives of both humans and animals. The list of challenges is too long to list all of them here.\n\nHowever, it takes months to find a suitable developer for a project, even in the world of finance, where money is not the biggest problem. Now try to imagine, how hard may it be for nature-related projects, like NationalTrust (UK), Greenpeace, and many others.\n\nThat is where we help.

I have lived here all my life and I know great music events happen everyday because I’ve been there, seen it and I am happy to support it. Last year has probably been the hardest for many Musicians - Nearly all the best Live Music Venues have closed down - BIG RED / LOCK TAVERN / THE MONARCH and many others. Most Alternative Music has been pushed to East LONDON and It's pretty hard getting gigs. So, I will be hosting a few MUSICIANS MEETUPS and I welcome anyone playing music or searching for fellow musicians to come down for a drink 🙂🍻\n\nOver the last 5 years of running this Group, I have had a lot of people come and express an interest in meeting other musicians to form bands. It’s difficult meeting the right people so if you are a Singer, Guitarist, Bassist or Drummer, have a band or think there’s anything we might be interested in then this might be a good group for you.\nWe put on our own nights and are always looking for great bands to see around London.

The organisers are not able to do everything so we are particularly interested in new members who are willing/able to host/organise events.\n\nWe appreciate not everyone is comfortable with uploading a face photo but this is preferred if possible as it does help with identification when meeting up for events (especially new people). However, if you prefer just add a photo of anything to get through the photo required section.\n\nAlso with new members there is an admin/joining fee required (currently £5 for individual membership or £10 for plus one membership) to go towards MeetUp fees.\n\nEncore: Theatre and Events for Friends to Enjoy is a Closed Group (acceptance for membership is at the discretion of organisers subject to availability). Please do not be offended should it not be possible to accept a request to join. This is more likely if you already belong to 10 or more other MeetUps as we are looking for active members and if you already belong to loads of other groups that's unlikely.

Current members can also recommend people to join the group.\n \nWe hope you will enjoy being a part of Encore and if you have an idea for a show or event please let me know and we will investigate, or better still have a go and organise it yourself as it will be possible to add extra organisers to Meetup.","city":"Chalfont St Peter","state":"F8","country":"gb","isPrivate":true,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"18502610","name":"KENRIC Lesbian Social Group","link":"https://www.meetup.com/kenric-lesbian-social-group","description":"We’re a vibrant, inclusive and supportive social group, run entirely by volunteers.

It was THE place to connect deeply in the heart of London.\nI am proud of what we did, and of our members who kept showing up to further their journey into deeper connection.\n\nWe closed the group because our lives needed to go in different directions, but I never stopped missing our members or my events. I know that many will benefit from living a more deeply connected life..myself included... So, I'm bringing it back and expanding it throughout the UK and beyond.\n\nI can't wait to meet you and embark on this beautiful adventure!\n\n*With Passion, Purpose and Love*\n\n*David Saville*","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":true},{"id":"25899298","name":"FRENCH LONDON EXPERIENCE - FLE","link":"https://www.meetup.com/french-london-experience-meetup","description":"\"You will love French, the French and France\". \n\nFrench London Experience is an intiative that I've launched to promote connections between French and British cultures. \n\nIt offers various ways to practise your French and to learn about French culture. We have a lot of events and services to improve your knowledge about France, its people, culture, history, political organisation, culinary traditions, way of life and way of working, and much more... \n\nThe activities take place in different forms - meetings, one-to-one, small groups, sessions, lectures, guided tours - in a variety of venues such as cafes, parks, companies, theatres, cinemas, gardens, exhibitions, museums, meeting rooms, and online.\n\nAttendees will be encouraged to engage in different ways along events.\n\nLast, a native French professional, I offer private tuitions and can reply to a various range of specific requests from lessons to works or any support in French (training, welcoming, writing, speaking, voice-recording,...)\n\nKeywords are ENTHUSIASM, ADAPTABILITY and PASSION\n\nAny question or request?\nDrop me a line frenchlondonexperience at gmail dot com\n\nWebsite\n[https://www.frenchlondonexperience.com/](https://www.frenchlondonexperience.com/?fbclid=IwAR3AqarNR1W5yav_DL1dCNuQddEOSgDju762CbuIV2HbknnrL4z8rB2Iqas)\n\nList of public events:\n[https://www.meetup.com/French-London-Experience-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/French-London-Experience-Meetup/?fbclid=IwAR3AqarNR1W5yav_DL1dCNuQddEOSgDju762CbuIV2HbknnrL4z8rB2Iqas)","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"36377553","name":"Moon Circles, Ceremonies, Meditations & More","link":"https://www.meetup.com/sw-london-healing-circles-ceremonies","description":"You are invited to join this group and attend one of the many circles, ceremonies and free live morning meditations I will be offering.\n\n* **OFFERINGS:**\n\n**Free Morning Meditations**\n\nWeekly 30min morning meditations where we'll explore and I'll guide different types of meditation, depending on the energies of that morning (e.g. breath-work, movement, visualisation, guided meditation etc.)\n\n**Moon Circles & Cacao Ceremonies**\n\nThere will also be beautiful sacred monthly moon circles & cacao ceremonies that you are welcome to join.

I have made a decision that every year the group will focus on a different way to explore our beautiful city and connect to likeminded people.\n\nFollowing the last 2 years of Covid and restrictions, it is only natural that we now all value the simpler things in life we might have taken for granted before, more deeply.\n\nI am inviting you to see your life, your world with new eyes....\nI am inviting you to become an explorer in your own city.\nAn explorer in the world.\nAn explorer with yourself and others.\nI invite you to awaken awe and playfulness and see what happens....\n\nWhether you have just moved to London or have lived here all your life, or if you live outside of London but always wanted to explore the forgotten or hidden parts of London, while meeting new people then this invitation is for you, if deep down inside you have an adventurer and explorer waiting to come out! All adults are welcome.\n\nI will be running a variety of events: my aim is to put events together that will unite people to come together in this amazing city (and sometimes even venture further afield!) and just have fun. And in the process slow down to really take in the beauty that is life and make magic moments. \n\n\n\n\n**IS THIS GROUP FOR YOU?**\nThis is for you if you are an adventurer/explorer at heart, you are open to new experiences, curious, energetic and enthusiastic about life and living in London and interested in exploring it in different ways. For me the lure of setting up this group wasn't just about getting out the house to see the city I have lived in for so many years but rather to explore London, in a new and exciting way! And it goes much deeper than that: it's about creating a sense of novelty, awe and wonder about our lives and our surroundings. For all we think we know so well and there's nothing left to discover, once we decide we are at heart \"intrepid explorers\" in our own lives and in our own city then we can choose to see everything around us with curiosity and fresh eyes and a renewed sense of wonder. It's an almost child like ability of playfulness, that we tend to lose as we become adults. This is what I hope to achieve with this group: recapture our sense of playfulness, discovery and wonder, while making connections with others! The magical moments happen when we are brave enough to explore and then make a connection with others on the same path!\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE:**\nI spent years working in top 5 star hotels as a Concierge so I got to know all the secret places that few people know about in London. In addition to that I have a passion for London and it's unique character and all the gems it hides in plain sight!I have escorted some friends and even business clients through London and they all loved how they were shown parts of London they didn't expect to see, and how much they enjoyed it! I am now also a Life Coach and Healer, so I love the idea of connecting people especially now following an extended period of Covid that will have affected our mental health and ability to connect with others. \n\nPlease feel free to drop me a line and suggest any events/activities you would like to take part in...all suggestions are welcome!","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"36425840","name":"Comedy Time: London","link":"https://www.meetup.com/comedy-time-london","description":"**A fresh line-up of the Worlds's Best Comics Every Week for free on Zoom!

I have lived here all my life and I know great music events happen everyday because I’ve been there, seen it and I am happy to support it. Last year has probably been the hardest for many Musicians - Nearly all the best Live Music Venues have closed down - BIG RED / LOCK TAVERN / THE MONARCH and many others. Most Alternative Music has been pushed to East LONDON and It's pretty hard getting gigs. So, I will be hosting a few MUSICIANS MEETUPS and I welcome anyone playing music or searching for fellow musicians to come down for a drink 🙂🍻\n\nOver the last 5 years of running this Group, I have had a lot of people come and express an interest in meeting other musicians to form bands. It’s difficult meeting the right people so if you are a Singer, Guitarist, Bassist or Drummer, have a band or think there’s anything we might be interested in then this might be a good group for you.\nWe put on our own nights and are always looking for great bands to see around London. If you are looking for Gigs or reliable promoters, then we can probably help point you in the right direction.\n\nAt the very least, we can talk music and then watch some bands :)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nWe are not responsible for you or your belongings. By attending events you agree to waiver liability for the Host :) Please bring ID to all events 18+ Thank you","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"2579112","name":"SMUGs!

With over **44,000 members**, we have now **organised over 1,700 hiking trips** including day walks, weekend hiking trips and an increasing range of foreign hiking trips travelling to Europe and beyond for adventure travel holidays. We target ourselves at the 25 to 49 age group (or young at heart) and whilst most members are within this age group, we do welcome anyone over the age, as well as keeping fit hiking is a great way to make new like minded friends.\nBetween our 3 most senior hike leaders we have over 50 years of experience of leading hikes across the UK as well as an ever increasing range of international trips and tours. We have every corner of the UK covered from Snowdonia in Wales to the Lake District, the great Scottish Highlands and even the far off corners like Cornwall.\nPlease do take a look at our (over 400) independent group reviews:\n[http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all](http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all)\n\nWe have 47 different day and weekend trips that have all been pre hiked and meticulously planned. We organise all the logistics for our hiking trips so that you can just turn up, walk and have a great time and meet new people while enjoying the great outdoors.\n\nIf you enjoy hiking and are based in the UK and looking to meet new like minded friends, Outdooraholics is for you and we look forward to welcoming you to the group!\n\n**Who attends our events?**\nWe're mainly in our mid 20s to mid 40s, but age is no barrier as long as you are young at heart and over 18.\n\nMost of our members generally either live or work in London, although we have people from all over the UK attending and we've had several people visit from abroad for our trips and join us at our destination. After all you don't need to live in London to visit Cornwall, Wales or the Lake District!\n\nWe have a lot of international members - either here on work placements or to live and this brings a superb cultural variety and mix of life experiences to the group and helps to make our trips so interesting and diverse.\n\nWe get a lot of people who attend their first event on their own and we always go out of our way to make everyone very welcome on our trips. They have proven to be a great way to meet people and make new friends as well as to see this wonderful island\n\n**Can I really turn up alone?**\nYes of course - most people do! Please don't be nervous about attending your first event - we have all been in the same boat at some point of turning up at an event alone and knowing nobody. To help introduce people to the group and indeed hiking we have designed 27 different hiking day trips which are a superb way to come and meet the group and we can assure you of a very warm welcome whatever event you choose and there are bound to be others who are attending their first event too. Hiking is a great way of meeting like minded people and making new friendships whilst keeping fit and seeing wonderful places too.\nIf you are nervous about committing to a weekend trip, please don't be, almost everyone has turned up to an event before without knowing anyone and we all know what it's like. To help new members into the group we run 4 to 6 day trips a month which are an easy and low cost way to try our events.\n\n**What hiking trips do we organise?**\n**Day hikes**\nWe organise typically 6 to 8 day hiking trips a month and have 27 tried and tested routes that we use from London. All are pre walked and are picturesque routes that we carefully choose. All trips leave from a central London station and we arrange train tickets, so you can just turn up and enjoy a great day out with us.\n\n**Weekend hiking trips**\nWe organise 3 to 6 weekend trips a month to all corners of the UK, showing you the very best that this country has to offer. We typically rent an entire Youth Hostel just for our group and after a great days hiking then either go to a local restaurant or cook at the hostel. We have over 18 different weekend trips and are adding new ones all the time!\nWe have a professionally trained chef who joins many of our trips and we regularly visit all of the UK's National Parks and designated \"Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\"\n\n**Trips abroad**\nWe offer an ever increasing variety of trips from 3 nights up to a week and will be having a number of new trips added in 2022. Where possible we aim for twin bed rooms and put the meticulous planning into our foreign trips so that you can have a great time and get to see the best of the area that you're visiting. It is a legal requirement (as well as advisable for safety) in many foreign mountainous locations to have an internationally qualified guide and for many of our foreign trips we have a local or native speaking guide.\n\nWhat else do we organise?\n\n**Socials**\nAs well as walking trips, we organise several pub socials per year in central London locations as well as discount nights at outdoor stores in central London.\nWe do focus on the outdoor events more than socials but we can recommend a good social group who do the following events:\nPub crawls, social events, wine tastings, sightseeing, making new friends, dining adventure, new in town drinks, food and cooking related events, exploring London's night life, social drinks, 18s, Go Ape, Treasure Hunts, Go Karting and Paintball\n\n**Outdoor activities**\nWe've been offering multi activity weekends for several years and have both offered or will be bringing the following activities to our weekends - some in London and some that we have to travel to:\nSky diving, coasteering, camping, canoeing and hiking weekends, horse riding, paragliding, parachute jumping, pot holing, yoga breaks, fitness weekends, SCUBA, travel, sightseeing, travelling abroad, indoor and outdoor rock climbing, skydiving, cycling, trekking, backpacking, yoga breaks and tours, holiday getaway breaks, travelling, adventure weekends, sailing, coast walking, long distance walking, caving, fitness weekends, hiking abroad, rock climbing, Go Ape, zip wires, navigation training, historic sightseeing, countryside conservation, overseas trips, the 3 (three) peaks challenge, tennis, hiking and abseiling, go karting, exercise and activity weekends for hikers, treasure hunts, paintball, photograpy exhibitions, treasure and scavenger hunts around London, Paint-ball, charity trips and charity adventure nights with Hope for Homes, badminton, squash, recreation weekends, gorge walking, navigation courses, culture trips, community trips, sea kayaking, kayaking along the Thames, via ferrata walks, orienteering, sailing, exercise boot camps, target shooting and clay pigeon shooting, shopping discount evenings at Cotswold Outdoors.

We're affiliated with two London cheese and wine groups and have even hosted cheese and wine evenings on our weekends!\n\n**Where do we visit?**\nThe fun places we visit and travel to on our walking trips in the UK include:\nSouth Downs, North Downs, Devon, Cornwall, The Lake District, Wales - Snowdon, the Gower and the Brecon Beacons, Dartmoor, the Peak District, Yorkshire Dales and Moors, the Chilterns, Isle of Wight, Kent Downs, Surrey Hills, the Cotswolds, Dorset, the Lake District, The Yorkshire 3 Peaks Challenge, the National 3 Peaks Challenge, the Yorkshire dales and moors and on up to Scotland and Ben Nevis.\nWe also arrange some super foreign walking trips to hike to destinations such as:\nHigh Atlas mountains, Everest Base Camp, the Pyrenees, the Dolomites, Granada Mountains, Nepal, Goa, Kilimanjaro, Andalucia and as the group grows we will continue to offer many more too!\n\n**What trips are we planning for the future?**\nWe are forever expanding our trips and have some wonderful destinations that we will be hiking to in the future.\nWithin the UK we already visit most of its great national parks, but will be extending our trips to cover all of them:\nBrecon Beacons, Norfolk Broads, Cairngorms, Dartmoor, Exmoor, Lake District, Loch Lomond, New Forest, Northumberland, North York Moors, Dark Peaks, Peak District, Pembrokeshire Coast, Snowdonia, South Downs and the Yorkshire Dales.\nWe also visit designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty which have included and will include:\nArnside and Silverdale, Chichester Harbour, Chilterns, Cornwall, Cotswolds, Cranborne Chase & West Wiltshire Downs, Dedham Vale, Dorset, East Devon, Isle of Wight, Kent Downs, Lincolnshire Wolds Malvern Hills, Mendip Hills, Nidderdale, Norfolk Broads and Coast, North Devon, North Pennines, Northumberland Coast, North Wessex Downs, Quantock Hills, Shropshire Hills, Solway Coast, South Devon, Suffolk Coast and Heathlands, Surrey Hills, Tamar Valley Lake District and the breath taking Wye Valley.\n\nWe have also hiked many of the national long distance paths including:\nCotswold Way National Trail, Cumbria Coastal Way, Highland Way, East Riding Heritage Way, Grand Union Canal Walk, Hadrian's Wall Path National Trail, Herriot Way, Hertfordshire Way, Mendip Ring, North Downs Way National Trail, North-West Coastal Trail, Offa's Dyke Path National Trail, Peak District High Level Route, Norfolk Coast Path National Trail, Pembrokeshire Coast Path National Trail, Pennine Way National Trail, Snowdonia Round, Solent Way, South Downs Way National Trail, South West Coast Path National Trail, Southern Upland Way, Thames Path National Trail, Wainwrights Way, Wales Coast Path, Wessex Ridgeway Trail, West Highland Way, Westmorland Way, White Peak Way, Wilts and Berks Canal Towpath, Winchcombe Way, Offa's Dyke (near the River Wye and Forest of Dean) and Wye Valley Walk\nWe also run and are planning a number of trips abroad including: Kilimanjaro, Nepal, hiking to Everest base camp, Tenerife, Croatia, Slovakia, France, Poland, The High Tatras, Russia, The Alps, Gran Canaria (Canary Islands), the Dolomites, Morocco and the High Atlas Mountains, Norway, Italy, Iceland, The Fjords, the Pyrenees, Andalucia, The Pyrenees and the Amalfi Coast.\n\n**Why do we do it?**\nQuite simply - we all share a passion for the great outdoors and with all of our trip leaders being born and raised in the UK with a life long love of hiking, we can't wait to show you this great country!\nWe have so many wonderful experiences on our trips and many people have found a new love of the outdoors, met their partners through Outdooraholics and made what are likely to be lifelong friendships.\nOur organisers can't wait to show you this great country and why we all developed such a lifelong love of hiking here all those decades ago\n\n**Yoga health and wellness retreats**\nWe offer a range of superb value yoga retreats in the UK, which we call Yogaholics trips. We take your safety and the great reputation of our yoga/hiking trips very seriously and we only ever use professional full time yoga instructors. We also typically have a professional chef to ensure we have wonderful, healthy and revitalising food. We follow the same great formula as with our hiking weekends - great organisation, great home cooked food, pre planned and hiked routes and highly experienced hike leaders and using hostels allows us to do this at a great price too. We look forward to bringing you an even more expanded range of Yogaholics trips as we enter our 4th year of these Yogaholics trips in 2015!\nWe have created a great range of hostel based yoga trips on this wonderful concept, but if you would like more luxury hiking/yoga trips also run by a professional yoga instructor, we can highly recommend the excellent Yoga Trails\n\n**Why Outdooraholics?**\nA very good question. There are some superb London based walking groups on Meetup - Backabush are well known for over a decade of organising superb hiking weekends and brought the whole concept of great value hiking trips to Meetup and Trailblazer have been organising an excellent and huge range of days hikes for over 5 years now. Both groups we highly recommend and regularly hear great things about their trips and both have inspired many other groups to offer similar events to theirs. 1000 Foot Hiking club is also highly recommended - run by some inspirational people on a non profit basis with all money raised going to a water aid charity.\nExcept for Outdooraholics most of the major London hiking groups on Meetup have evolved out of Backabush and Trailblazer and generally run the same format as their trips. Whilst we'd be lying if we said we weren't inspired by the great trips these groups run, we wanted to do something different and new and created Outdooraholics from scratch and we believe giving our trips a quite different flavour. We get you out of London on aaa rated trips. We took a very simple idea as our basis - of organising all of the logistics for our hiking trips so that you don't have to. We advise you what to bring, you turn up and you'll have a great time. All of our trips are run by trip leaders from that particular country so we believe they can show you the country and culture like only a local can. We organise an equal mix of day hikes and weekend trips and put the same detailed planning into both.\nWe also try to use local tour guides for the majority of our trips so that you can get a proper insight in to the history, culture and country that you're visiting - after all you wouldn't expect to visit Russia for example and be \"shown\" the country and it's cultures by a British person!\nWe plan all of our trips in advance including the routes that we take to ensure that we show you the best of an area and also that we know what the risks are on the tracks and indeed that the trails are passable and safe. All of the photos on our trips are taken by one of our hike leaders, from that trip, on the paths that you will actually be hiking so that you can best decide which trips appeal to you. The great outdoors does carry risks which is why we pre walk and plan all of our routes and trips.\nWe believe we offer the most diverse range of both day hikes and weekend trips available in the UK.\nWe only offer superb trips and we even have a professional chef who joins us on many of our weekend trips to offer great food, which is much appreciated after a tough days hiking.\n\n**Safety**\nOur main hike leader has undertaken both a four day [Walk Group Leader](http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/walking-group-leader-award) course accredited by the MLT (Mountain Leader Training) and a six day [Mountain Leader](http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/mountain-leader-award) course (also accredited by the MLT) as well as having a two day outdoor Activity First Aid course and over 20 years of extensive and diverse hiking and leading experience. All of our trips are run by very experienced hikers with Outdoor Activity First Aid qualifications and most of our trip leaders are a minimum of Mountain Leader trained with 2 of our trip leaders having a military background. Sadly the outdoors always presents risks but through our experience, training and careful planning as well as pre planning and walking all of our routes we do our best to minimise those.\n\n**Further information**\nYou can email us at: info@outdooraholics.co.uk\nOr you can follow us and our hiking adventures on Facebook:\n[http://www.facebook.com/outdooraholics](http://www.facebook.com/outdooraholics)\nWe sincerely look forward to meeting you at one of our weekend or hiking day trip adventures soon and can ensure a warm welcome from the Outdooraholics team to you\n\n**Joining the Team**\nWe are looking for experienced hike leaders (ideally with at least Mountain Leader level training) and whilst we demand a lot from people, working with the largest hiking group in London and one of the largest in Europe brings a lot of advantages too. Safety and enjoyment of people attending our trips is paramount. You don't have to be based in the South East or London as we have a demand for people in all locations.

Lucy and Isabelle co-founded Divorce Club back in 2016 for one simple reason – we know that no one should go through divorce alone! It's now the largest Divorce Club in the UK.**\n\nYou may be feeling lonely, unsupported or simply looking for friendly help & advice in order to move on. Afterall, what other life event can uproot you from your home, shake your financial security, reduce your time with your children and make friends and family disappear overnight? Sometimes you don’t know where to turn, or just feel angry or sad.\n\nThat’s where we at Divorce Club London can help.\n\nWe know it can be really tough going through a divorce. It’s hard to find people who know how you feel unless they’ve been through it. Divorce Club London is hosted by people who have been through a divorce and who know exactly what you’re going through (whatsmore our co-founder Isabelle is a clinical psychologist). So we know that the best remedy for the pain of divorce is to meet others in the same boat and make a fresh start. We also know that trying to navigate the legal and financial side is an additional pressure, just when you’re at your lowest ebb.\n\nDivorce Club London connects people to every single resource they may need to get through a divorce from the moment of separation to moving on and meeting someone new. We aim to reduce the sense of isolation and overwhelm in the first stage of separation but also look to help people identify how to look forward and rebuild their lives. We fundamentally believe out of the ashes of the end of a relationship, new beginnings and a huge opportunity for growth arise.\n\nFor newly separated people we offer advice and help on the process and emotional overwhelm. As people go through the process they have continuous access to legal and financial advice while also being able to tap into a community of people who can share the roller coaster of milestones, difficulties and triumphs. And for those in the later stages we offer coaching for goal setting, and online sessions for moving on, dating and growth.\n\nDivorce Club London provides expert information that takes the mystery and fear out of divorce. We have guest speakers from top law firms, mediators, psychologists, parenting experts, divorce coaches, financial advisors, dating experts and many more - advice that usually costs a lot of money!\n\nFor less than the price of a weekly takeout coffee, you can join us and meet other people who know exactly what you’re going through.\n\nMembership includes access to:\n\n* Weekly social zoom calls\n* Legal Q&As with respected family lawyers\n* Financial Q&As\n* Parenting sessions\n* Goal setting\n* Book clubs\n* Divorce orientated workshops\n* Access to a 24/7 community messaging channel\n* In real life meetups and socials\n\nFor just £7.99 a month, you can get inclusive access to all of our events, access to chat in our private community, and a service which aims to match you with friends. We even give you the first month for free.\nWhatsmore, we host a free Meetup group session once a month so you can come and see what Divorce Club is all about.\n\nSo we hope that you invest in giving yourself a better divorce, and a better recovery.

We will still be offering the female networking to put ladies in touch with each other beforehand when our events start again. I know from experience how hard it is when a lady becomes single and wants to get out to meet a new partner and make new single friends along the way. It is difficult when all of your friends are in couples and your attached friends cannot come out with you at the weekend to a singles event if they don't wish to cause problems in their relationships. Coming out alone is not easy so we put ladies in touch with each other so they can have a chat before coming to an event together.\nI should add that this is what we do for our events with Contact Singles. I daresay the other organisers of events promoting on this group have their own type of ice-breakers.","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"30019514","name":"Young LGBTQ+ Professionals (4000+ members)","link":"https://www.meetup.com/young-lgbt-professionals","description":"ABOUT:\nAre you a young professional in London looking to meet other LGBT young professionals? Then we hope to see you at the coming drinks! They are organised every other Tuesday in the Yard bar, top floor, from 7pm onwards. We don't do guest lists, so even if you didn't sign up through Meetup you are more than welcome.\nMany have noticed that it can be difficult to meet up with the LGBT community once you leave university. For this reason we've decided to start organising drinks for young professionals, intended for those who love to have a drink with like-minded people after a busy day of work. Do spread the word, and bring friends, colleagues and family!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ:\n\n\n\n\n❓It's my first time and I'm coming alone, should I be nervous?\nNo, you found the right event! Almost everyone joins these drinks alone and there are always a bunch of first timers. Just grab a drink and say hi to those around the reserved tables and you'll be absolutely fine :)\n\n\n\n\n❓I cannot make it at 7pm, can I come later?\nYes, definitely! There will always be one of the organisers present from 7pm onwards, but most people just join whenever they can. There is no official 'start' so to say, and it usually stays busy till around 10pm-11pm. For first timers it can be easier to mingle if you come before 8pm, when it's not that busy yet.\n\n\n\n\n❓How often are the drinks and where are they held?\nWe have drinks every two weeks from 7pm in the Yard bar in Soho. Sometimes we organise other events such as pub crawls and picnics. Just keep an eye on the Meetup page.\n\n\n\n\n❓Is there a dress code?\nNope, not at all. Just wear whatever you want.\n\n\n\n\n❓Is there a cost?\nOnly for whatever drinks you buy at the bar.\n\n\n\n\n❓What's the age profile?\nMost people who attend range from their early twenties to their early thirties.\n\n\n\n\n❓Are the Tuesday drinks for networking?\nNo, the drinks are super casual, and and not intended to find your new dream job. We have people from all different professional backgrounds, so it's always cool to hear what others are up to.\n\n\n\n\n❓I don't drink alcohol, can I come?\nOf course! Since it's on a Tuesday many take it easy, so you won't be an outlier.\n\n\n\n\nA note on behaviour:\nThis Meetup attracts a diverse group of people of all different backgrounds, personalities, and opinions. We aim to provide a safe space for people of all backgrounds, gender identities, and ethnicities. Whilst similarities and differences in both opinions and personalities are inevitable, we will not tolerate racism, bullying, and/or discrimination. ","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"21796859","name":"Iceni Chapter Widows Sons Masonic Bikers Association (UK)","link":"https://www.meetup.com/widows-sons-iceni-chapter","description":"<p>The Iceni Chapter is a member of the Widows Sons Masonic Bikers Association, we are a not for profit organisation and our area covers the London, Essex, Hertfordshire and surrounding counties.</p>\n<p>The Widows Sons is an International Association which is open to all Freemasons who enjoy motorcycling and have a desire to ride with and associate with their fraternal brothers.

It can be tough enough ‘coming out’, but being introverted can make it even more of a challenge and sometimes you need a gentle push.\n\nSo, whether you consider yourself to be ‘gay’, ‘bi’, ‘bi-curious’, ‘pansexual’ or any other label; whether you are ‘in the closet’, ‘out’ or in the process of ‘coming out’; whether you are vulnerable or feel at risk, this group brings us together. We embrace those who have experienced depression, anxiety, loneliness or isolation, especially if you may be considered on the spectrums of ADHD, Autism & Asperger’s, Bipolar, OCD and/or Schizophrenia.\n\nYou may be a highly sensitive person who experiences intense highs and lows to an extreme degree. You may be an artistic Creative with a vivid inner world hidden and locked away. You may feel easily overwhelmed by large groups of people, unsettled by the turbulence of the LGBTQ+ dating scene or sidelined/neglected in a whirlwind of rapidly spinning social circles. Anxiety may have even prevented you from moving forwards in friendships and relationships with other people because you are afraid of either hurting or getting hurt. This Meetup group is designed for you!\n\nHave you ever taken years to build up the confidence to attend an event only to be disappointed? Want to attend an LGBTQ+ event but held back by your shyness? Simply come as you are. There is no need to pretend anymore. This is a get together for people who do not want to be alone, to feel comfortable, and foster a nice, friendly circle of people. And if you would like to attend but do not feel like talking much, then that is cool, too! Take it at your own pace.\n\n===\nDETAILS\n\nThis free group is for friendship and dating, designed to reach out to others and create mutual support. The concept is simple: helping one another get out there in the world. Some meet-ups are limited to 6 or 12 places so that it is not too overwhelming for new members. I will provide my contact details 24 hours before each event either in a group e-mail or in a private message. Do feel free to get in touch if you would like to have a chat about the event before you attend!\n\nI do not charge fees for attending our meet-ups. All I ask is that a one-off discretionary donation is made for your first time. This is to help cover the cost of running the group. Meetup groups are not free to run and cost £180 over the course of a year. I have put a link below (Paypal) where you give a one-off donation of £10 (or any amount) to help out. The group will always remain free so there is no obligation but it would be greatly appreciated.

Wouldn't you prefer to be able to say \"I know what I like and I know why I like it\" ? Do you love art but sometimes feel secretly guilty for not 'getting it'? Do you ever stroll through a gallery and feel you should be gaining much more from your experience? Do you end up leaving the gallery more tired and confused than enlightened or inspired? It doesn't have to be like that. In a regular series of online talks I will guide you through some of the fundamental ideas in Art. We will identify the key features of the main styles in art: Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, 19th c Realism and Modern Art. We will look at such essential components as technique, colour, space, light and shade, composition. We will examine the main subjects in art : Portrait, landscape, still life, religious, secular and mythological scenes.

We don't mind coming up at some point with a new name, let us know of any great name you have in mind.\nWe ran Figure Drawing classes since 2004 when there was only about 10 2D Figure Drawing classes left in London UK. This was the time when Ipad/Wacom tablet classes started to overtake. We, I mean I went a bit mad about it and by influencing as much as humanly possible we had 650 classes weekly in London in 2013 and run about 120 in 10 years, in all areas of the city, was seen on Tele, Radio, press regularly. This crusade was about anything and everything but capital gain and hasn't changed. For absolutely everyone to be able to draw, Online zoom classes are perfect as you always get the best seat and can use equipment that you can never use at the Local weekly classes.\n\n**Classes:**\n**Saturday and Sunday** every 2 weeks I meet Londoners in Central London Park, Hyde Park corner and gently push others like Clissold Park Locals to do the same, like I did, as those are Free events. If I am in Brighton someone else's welcomes guests on the day.\n**Monday:** Every Monday as this is the most regular class of the week, I or someone I trust guide the group which again is only possible online, for 1/2 the session. Then I turn my camera towards my Drawing board or using the chat on zoom, help those who turn their own camera on their drawings. Other participants will never hear, see anything so a bit like private tuition. This is something offered only to those who really mean to achieve results in the future and need to pay a tiny £5/week that helps me pay the models with and all our video and running of our website. Without those people keen to achieve and me absolutely keen to help them none of all this would ever be possible.\nThose who don't need help on that day simply put the volume down.\n**Tuesday** is our together day for a little extra Socializing and to draw each other's faces mainly. Sometime hands, or feet, Costumes, hats, jewelry etc... To keep the experience fun fun fun who ever poses must do a funny face before the more or less still posing for 20 mins :). If you llok like anyone let me know so more will turn up. The first time we did one one those, before any Doodle events ever existed was in 2006 and was called Happy Drawing Circles with up to 20 in each circle.\n**Wednesday** about every 2 weeks depending on level of attendance we do Exceptional Life Drawing themes that most attendees go to Live or continue drawing after the class from the recordings if they are Weekly members (£5 all incl.)\n**Thursday** is our Partly clothed to completely clothed/costumed models day also every 2 weeks on Low season and weekly otherwise.\nTo recapitulate: A live experience cost £2.50, A live experience and/or working from the recording is £10 or the weekly pass inclusive of all events is £5/week or £7.50 for Pro Class organizers who need little help.\nFor a complete list of what this Pass gives you feel free to read our Prices page at www.thelifedrawingnetwork.com\n**The motivation** part is also in our pricing as if you Buy a £10 ticket to be able to work/finish your work from a video, if you email us a Drawing that we can exhibit on our Life Arts Gallery page, we refund £7 and will show your Art to potential buyers/investors.\nIf you want or intend to model one day for classes we let people give it a go at the end of any of our classes and offer Completely Free services to them for Life, my life.\nIf you or someone you know would like to be promoted for anything in person, from Artist, Art teacher, Class organizer, Art writer, let me know.\nWe'll be writing the History of Comtemporary Figure drawing so please share good old times stories...
