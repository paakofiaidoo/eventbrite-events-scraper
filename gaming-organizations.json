We have two dungeons and dragons groups, that meet up on alternating Tuesdays, that are unfortunately now full. If you fancy running your own campaign we are currently looking for DMs. We run board game nights every week on Thursday, with new games being added to our library at each meet up.\n\nA little about me, Aidan, the organiser and founder of this club. My introduction to board games and TTRPGs began with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, and Talisman. My journey as a nerd continued with games on the original PlayStation, Diablo, Final Fantasy, and Tomb Raider. Then my brother introduced me to novels by Terry Pratchett, the Redwall series, and the Earthsea Quartet by Ursual K. Le Guin. I also dabbled with Warhammer. Safe to say that sealed my identity, and the course of my own personal interests for life. Now I have a space to share and enjoy these interests with others.",

This Meetup will then allow you to host and organise it. If you'd like to host an event, simply write that in the discussion and you will be made an event organiser.\n\nThere are no rules on which games you can or cannot play. This is simply up to the group to decide, perhaps in advance by making the event a game-specific event, or by mutual agreement.\n\nPlease do join and let's start organising more board game sessions all across London!\n\nFor example, perhaps you have a local gaming cafe but no-one to play with, then simply post a date and time and a limit of how many players the game(s) you want to play suits and see if anyone signs up.

Fun and laughter followed along with the scrambling and spinning of dice with the occasional grumble of how lucky your opponent was at throwing their lucky dice rolls.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, people don't always find the time to play face to face and the unfortunate result is playing backgammon online in from of a screen and questioning whether the dice rolls are rigged or not.&nbsp;Sapphire Backgammon changes this, so why not come along to a warm and welcoming environment and play real people?\"</em> Chris S.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hello,</p><p><strong><em>Meetup fortnightly on Sundays at 3pm</em></strong></p><p>A very warm welcome to Backgammon Lovers and those inspiring to learn and improve their game in a social and friendly environment.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope that our members are all keeping safe during these difficult times.</p><p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sapphire Backgammon Social Group is six years old - we held our first Meetup in June 2015 and we are coming up to our 150th Meetup. Our membership is fast approaching 750 and rising. Given the current Covid climate, on average between 8 and 12 members attend our fortnightly meetups and our largest turnout ever was a busy and fun 29 backgammon lovers turning up to one of our events.</p><p>This is an established and friendly group for backgammon players of all standards - from beginners to champions, it really doesn't matter what level you are or how competitive or not that you choose to be - we have quite a selection of players, both men and women, from diverse backgrounds from across the globe. My aim is to have a laid back sociable afternoon that drifts into the evening with people who want to play backgammon in a friendly and welcoming environment.&nbsp;We sometimes have fun tournaments with small prizes for those with a slight competitive edge. Through this group some of us have learnt to play with the doubling cube - that mysterious cube-like object with 2,4,8 etc that sits on the side of some boards. We have recently returned to the Civil Service Club after a nearly four year break, but might try out other venues nearby.</p><p><em>Please bring your own&nbsp;backgammon board</em>, however, both I and others should have our own, and I do sometimes carry a spare or two -&nbsp;we simply need one board between two players.&nbsp;We are always delighted to play on different boards that are different in size, style, feel and price and to meet the players behind their boards.</p><p>I will ask for a 2 or £3 contribution that helps me pay Meetup (yes Meetup sadly isn't free for Organisers and I pay a handsome six-monthly subscription fee of around a hundred pounds, including during lockdown when no events were held) and this covers other admin costs.&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to meeting and playing this enjoyable game with you soon.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p><p>Christopher&nbsp;:-)</p>",

We will be expected to buy drinks and/or food (Do not bring food/drink from outside), which seems reasonable as the prices are lower than any other London D&D venue on MeetUp.\n\nTo be clear, I am not an employee of O'Niel's. I'm just a DM who doesn't enjoy long journeys on public transport 🤗\n\nPlease join the group if interested. We will decide on a first date soon. Pictures of the venue will follow, along with other information as it is decided.\n\nIf you are new to D&D, don't worry, we'll make sure you get good guidance. You don't need to bring anything, but dice, paper and pencil will be useful 🎲 Otherwise, use the D&DBeyond app.\n\nIf you are a DM, or want to try being a DM, please do message me as DMs will be needed 😎",

We enjoy a wide variety of board games that include euros, deck builders, dungeon crawlers, area control, cooperatives, 18xx, legacy and even dexterity and social games on occasion. There are a wide range of complexities and game lengths and it is common for us to play 2-3 hour games or even longer especially on weekends with shorter games in between.\nThere are some games that we don’t allow - please see our [rules page](https://www.londononboard.com/rules-regulations) for details.\n\nOur events are very much dependent on attendees bringing the games that they’d like to play and/or are happy to share with the group. It’s certainly not mandatory for you to bring games nor to allow others to use those that you do bring as we understand that it’s not always practical, but it would be wonderful if you can bring and teach games whenever possible.\n\nLondon is a beautiful city with many pubs and hotels with private spaces that are available for hire typically with minimum spends or a deposit. As we are passionate about keeping our club free to attend, we make mutually beneficial agreements with the venues. This provides us with a dedicated space and in return, we make it worth their while by being respectful and spending on food & drink. Without this symbiotic relationship, London on Board would not be possible so we would very much like to encourage attendees to remember to visit the bar regularly throughout the event. Under no circumstances should food or drink from outside be brought into the venue.\n\nLondon on Board is not-for-profit and organised by a small group of volunteers. When we have spare time, you will often find us looking for new venues, wrangling with the quirks of meetup.com and making improvements to the website!\n\n**Links**\nRules: [https://www.londononboard.com/rules-regulations](https://www.londononboard.com/rules-regulations)\nNewbie Guide: [https://www.londononboard.com/the-lob-newbie-guide](https://www.londononboard.com/the-lob-newbie-guide)\nWebsite: [https://www.londononboard.com/](https://www.londononboard.com/)\nBGG guild: [https://boardgamegeek.com/guild/586](https://boardgamegeek.com/guild/586)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Organisers\nEsme, Felix & Rachel",

Away from the burn of every day work/life. <br></p>\n<p>• <b>WHAT DO WE PLAY?</b> We play a vast eclectic assortment of card, miniatures and boardgames from casual ameritrash to deep thinking euros; Agricola to Zombicide, Avalon to Werewolf, Age Of Empires to Scythe etc. Alongside gaming we also participate in cinema, escape rooms, eating out, outdoor events &amp; activities. We're also known for play-testing new game mechanics and prototypes for gaming companies and independent designers. In fact, several of our members are in the gaming industry. <br></p>\n<p>•&nbsp;<b>WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?</b> We are seeking other like minded adventurers who are reliable, sensible &amp; amicable and looking to join a social circle as well as a gaming group. Membership is free, there are no costs or joining fees. All we ask in return is for you to leave your 'troubles' at the doorstep and de-stress from a long days work over a boardgame without drama or maintenance. We all have our 'hang-ups', lets not bring it to the table, folks :) <br></p>\n<p>• <b>DO I NEED ANY BOARDGAMING EXPERIENCE?</b> Not at all. All we ask is for the ability to learn &amp; pick up new games esp advanced and modern games with the right attitude and respect to other members. We do not play simple commercial games such as Snakes &amp; Ladders, Monopoly, Cluedo etc. <br></p>\n<p>•&nbsp;<b>HOW DO I JOIN?</b> Please message an organiser or send us a joining request for a 2 month trial membership as we often play at private residences and not just public houses/locations. We will not take any offence if you find our group not suitable for you at the end of the trial as we understand not everyone will be suitable for our group. Please, do consider if you can actually attend before joining. <br></p>\n<p>• <b>ANY REGULAR LOCATIONS?</b> We have regular weekly public gaming venues in Central London as well as private residences around the local area. We find Central the best mutual common ground for members to travel in from as we live all over London. <br></p>\n<p>• <b>COOL, SOUNDS GOOD. ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW?</b> We are a PRIVATE group of mates, not an open forum or a public service. As such we're aiming to remain small and retain the circle-of-friends atmosphere as opposed to a crowded sweaty room filled with bad mannered strangers arguing over dice rolls. All members must display a true, genuine photo of themselves on Meetup so we know who to expect and look for when they attend. Fake names/photos/profiles will be automatically dismissed. If you think we are for you then get in touch, we're always on the look out for the right individuals with the right attitude. The password to apply for a trial membership is 'DeathAdder'. <br></p>\n<p><b>If you would like to find out more, please scroll down.</b> <br></p>\n<p><b>**WARNING: TROUBLE MAKERS AND DRAMA SEEKERS WILL BE EXPELLED AND BANNED. DO NOT APPLY IF THIS IS YOU</b><b>. POOR BEHAVIOUR AND INAPPROPRIATENESS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER MEETUPS FOR THAT. WE ARE NOT A SUPPORT GROUP FOR YOUR PERSONAL ISSUES &amp; MACHINATIONS**</b></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/4/2/600_448888994.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><b> Additional Info (you don't need to read any further, but if you insist :)</b><b> <br> <br>• WHAT ARE THE EVENTS LIKE?</b> Being a private members group everyone knows each other and it is a very warm fun atmosphere in an enjoyable safe environment. It is more like a social circle of friends sharing similar interests, humour and hobbies than a random gaming club where you don't know the person you're rolling dice with. Something to bear in mind if you are interested in our group :)<b> <br> <br>• WHY ARE YOUR EVENT LOCATIONS AND MEMBERS HIDDEN?</b> We often host events at our own homes. Would you want the world to know where you live?<b> <br> <br>• SECURITY IS IMPORTANT, HEY?</b> Absolutely. We have had disruptive members in the past (you know who you are) and would like to avoid these types of trouble makers in the future. As a meetup group we function more like a collective of friends so if you're manipulative, ill/short tempered or inappropriate then you may want to reconsider. <b> <br> <br>• WHO CAN JOIN?</b> We have a very diverse demographic ranging from age, gender, profession and ethnicity. We do attract a lot of females, professionals and academics due to our safeguarded environment and security attitudes, but absolutely anyone can register interest so long as you are of the right persuasion and character. Please message an organiser if you have any further questions.<b> <br></b></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/5/7/600_448889015.jpeg\"></p>\n<p><b> <br></b></p>",

London AFOLS offers an early evening get-together for Adult Fans Of Lego, or AFOLs for short, based in or near London. Our meetups are suitable for anyone over the age of 18 who likes to build with Lego, no matter what their skill-level is. Whether you live in London or are visiting from elsewhere, you are welcome to join us having fun with Lego.\n\nWe get together on the second Monday or Tuesday of each month. As things get back to normal post Covid, we are in mixed mode: a real-life meetup followed by an online meetup. As 2022 progresses, we aim to transition to real-life meetups all the way.\n \nEach monthly Meetup has a different theme, perhaps a presentation about some aspect of Lego, then building something to theme in smaller break-out rooms. Sometimes we have special trading meetups, or competition nights. We try to keep it varied so there's something for everyone.\n\nAfter attending a Meetup, you are welcome to join our Slack discussion forum where we discuss Lego and other matters between meetups.\n\nPeople - We attract all sorts of people from a wide range of backgrounds. We are about 60:40 male:female. Attendance usually numbers around 40 people for pub meetups, and 30 for online meetups.\n\nAge range - we have members in their late teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, with 30s being the median group - just.\n\nPhotos - please upload a recognisable photo of yourself in your Meetup profile. It makes it easier for us to recognise and welcome newcomers. Also, be aware members may take pics at Meetups and upload to one of our social media sites so you need to be comfortable with a picture of yourself appearing online.\n\nCosts - We ask for a contribution of £5 per Meetup attended. This covers Meetup fees, website fees, postage, some Lego parts from time to time etc. Members pay via Paypal using a link supplied at the Meetup. Annual membership is also available for £50 a year, with renewals in April.\n\n*N.B. We are a Recognised Lego User Group (RLUG), meaning we are supported by **The LEGO Group** in Denmark and have a good relationship with them. However, we are neither controlled by the company nor sponsored by them.*",

It's a great team activity where we can draw on each other's skills to suceed and have a laugh.\n\nRooms are generally restricted to 6 players so I will be capping the events so join up quick to be included!

Or perhaps you were introduced to some simple card games as a child or play Solitaire on your phone and would like to find out how much fun it can be to learn a card game from which you need to be dragged screaming and kicking from the table at the end of the evening because it is so compelling! You may even be a poker player but want to branch out into something more interesting and less ruinous to the bank balance! <br>We play a range of different games from around the world, with a particualar focus on some of the most interesting strategic games from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as Skat, Doppelkopf, Koenigrufen and other tarot games, Jass, etc. However, we are also open to any friendly people who just want to come along and play their favourite card game (canasta, cribbage, euchre, hearts, spades, etc) or introduce others to a new game. The only constraints are that we do not play any form of poker, for which there are other meetup groups available, and we limit ourselves to traditional games which do not require a proprietary pack of cards. There are loads of meetup groups in London where you can play those types of game, but very few where one can play traditional card games. <br>Right, whose deal is it?</p>",

        "description": "**If \"boardgames\" to you means Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit and Cluedo...** then come and join us for the next step into the world of boardgames. Modern, 'euro style' games are of very high quality, can usually be learnt quickly and generally last for 90mins to 2 hours. What's more, they usually involve everyone all of the time, so you're not sitting around waiting for someone else to take their turn and you won't be 'knocked out' after the first half hour. All in all, they are much more fun and much more accessible than Monopoly and its more traditional counterparts!\nAlthough we sometimes play the heavier/more complicated games, we love to welcome new members and players. If you’re a relative newcomer to the boardgaming hobby, get in touch and we can make arrangements for a table to introduce you to the wonderful world of games beyond the traditional “roll the dice and move along the board” examples. Drop us a note outlining what you’ve played before (if anything) and we’ll make sure you have a good time. Some great introductory games include Settlers of Catan, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride – if you’ve never played these you’re in for a treat, or if you have, come and try something else.\n**If \"boardgames\" to you means Puerto Rico, Power Grid, Agricola and others...** you'll already be aware of the sorts of things we play!\n**Where and when:** We meet on Tuesday evenings at 6.30pm at the [Guildford Institute](http://www.guildford-institute.org.uk/). We have to pay for the room hire, though the space, tables, and lighting are excellent (much better than a typical pub). The Institute does serve some drinks and snacks, but not meals, so if you need dinner you have to arrange that separately before or after gaming.\nAlthough we try to start promptly (which means we can fit in the longer games that other clubs can’t!), please let us know if you’re going to be late (after 7pm) and we’ll try and schedule games accordingly – we generally manage a couple of games each week (per table) so we should be able to time it to maximise everyone’s playing time.\nWe also play 10am to 6pm one Saturday each month (check event listings - usually the second Saturday).\n**Fees**: The Guildford Gamers pay the Institute for the use of a room, so we make a modest charge for attending our sessions. The fee is £5 per person per session. Joining the club involves committing to regular monthly payments instead (currently £10, or £5 for weekend-only membership), and entitles the member to a vote on matters affecting the club.\nUnder-18s may attend for free. Students aged 18 or over in full time education with valid ID, and Seniors Citizens over 60, are entitled to a 50% discount.\nThe club is non-profit and fees are used solely to hire the venue and sundry costs (mainly Meetup fees).\n**More Information:** We have a [Guild page](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/294) on BoardGameGeek - the site for all boardgamers! BGG contains lots of information about all the games we play - and many more! \nWe look forward to seeing you :-)",

There's usually lots of games about, brought by members but please feel free to bring some of your own if there is something you'd like to play. Don't worry if you are completely new to board games, we are very inclusive and you'll have a fun night.",

        "description": "A group focused on arranging play sessions for the tabletop role playing game, Vampire: The Masquerade. The games make use of the 5th edition of the rule set.\n\nWHAT DO I NEED TO TAKE PART?\n\nA good imagination, and a bit of humor :) If you do have a set of d10 dice, and possibly a copy of the VTM V5 source book, you're welcome to bring them along. We do have spare dice and a source book with us, so no worries if you don't have them.\n\nI'VE NEVER PLAYED VTM BEFORE. IS THAT A PROBLEM?\n\nNo, not at all. The game is very easy to understand, and we'll help you along the way while you're playing. While the Endless Nights are very mysterious, and steeped in lore and history, you don't need to know any of it to actually play the game. In fact, discovering the secrets of the Kindred for the first time is a part of the fun!\n\nCAN I MAKE MY OWN CHARACTER?\n\nYes, you are allowed to make your own characters if you'd like. However, please make sure to read the restrictions on character creation for the individual one shots and chronicles you join. Those restrictions are there to make sure your chosen character can make the most of the story, so it's worth paying attention to them.\n\nWe do recommend that you use this app when generating a character, as it's quite user friendly:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.lilac.vampire_v5_character_creator&gl=GB\n\nI DON'T HAVE THE FIRST IDEA HOW TO MAKE A CHARACTER?\n\nNot a problem. Every chronicle and one shot will have pre-generated characters available for you to play. We do recommend that you install this app on your phone beforehand:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.lilac.vampire_v5_character_creator&gl=GB\n\nIt makes it quick and easy for us to send you a pre-generated character sheet.\n\nWHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO TAKE PART?\n\nYou *must* RSVP to an event. a story typically has between 2 to 5 players. Any more, and you'll spend a lot of timing watching other people play.\n\nYou must be 18+ to attend.\n\nWHAT IF THE PEOPLE IN MY GROUP ARE MEAN?\n\nThis group is about having fun, relaxing after a rough week at work and meeting some interesting people. Unsocial or inappropriate behavior is not tolerated, and swiftly dealt with. This is a safe space, and is open to all.",

        "description": "**Welcome to DnD Club**\nYou want to play Dungeons and Dragons. You’ve watched Critical Role, you bought the Starter Kit, you’ve created multiple characters...and you’re stuck. You are in the right place. I started this meetup to create a welcoming, safe, and encouraging community for tabletop roleplaying. We now have a international community of over 2000 players and we're coming to London!\n\nThis hobby can seem very difficult to access, and getting started can feel impossible. This group is about eliminating those barriers and creating a wonderful place for both new and experienced gamers.\n\n**Our mission:**\n\n*Heroic immersion:* Regardless of the system or DM, we want you to *feel* as if you are walking the forests of Mirkwood, through the world of Exandria, or into the dungeon of a Mad Mage. We immerse players, new and experienced, in classic, heroic adventures, in the theme of Tolkien, Lovecraft, Howard, and many more...every single session.\n\n*Reliability*: Not only do our games provide an excellent experience, they are reliable. We run at least 10 games per month, and our player attendance rate is above 95%. Additionally, we have a team of 30 DMs working together to ensure that we never cancel an event.\n\n*Player Driven:* Our games are player driven, putting you and your character at the center of the plot. Your choices will decide the outcome: from heroic victory to an untimely end. We encourage adventure feedback and try to make each session even better than the last.\n\nD&D is an awesome experience, and my tables are open to all players. I'll teach you everything you need to know, and everybody we play with is very welcoming to players interested in checking out the hobby. I bring all the essentials: minis, dice, play-map, etc.\n\n***Tickets:***\nHere's the secret to this group: we pay our DMs. Because of this, sessions run on time, with prepared facilitators, and typically full tables of players.\n\nAccordingly, all players are required to purchase their seats in advance to each session. Because preparation by the DM and other participants is impacted by the number of players, ticket reservations are final, no exceptions. Also, please do not \"drop in\" to the event. Cash is not accepted at the table.🔥🔮⚔️\n\n**Why on earth would I pay to play an RPG?** \nThree reasons: reliability, quality, and immersion. Because all our players have \"skin in the game\" they are much more invested. Because we compensate our DMs, they are always on point with an awesome adventure.\nI personally vet each DM and the DM team upholds rigorous quality standards of play.\n\n**Quality Standards:** \na) We make sure all participants have the materials they need, whether in person or online.\nb) Sessions occur on schedule, at the same date and time each week, unless all participants agree to a new date and time. We've run over 1,600 sessions and had essentially zero cancelations.\nc) Our players realize this is a cooperative endeavor. Mutual respect and cooperation is what we expect of all participants. DMs are trained in how to \"share the spotlight\" and no player is allowed to derail the experience.\nd) In game themes of sexual assault, rape, or racism are expressly prohibited. Obviously these things are also prohibited between people as well.\ne) DMs are highly responsive to feedback. We encourage all players to message either their DMs or me personally to ensure that each experience is awesome!\nf) Disruptive behaviors by participants are first resolved in game, and then addressed by DMs out of game. DMs may remove players from sessions if needed to ensure a quality session. (To date we've never had to do this because players tend to work really well together.)\ng) DMs are expected to be prepared and begin on time. They are expected to deliver a quality experience on the platform of their choosing (typically roll20 and discord), every session.\nh) DMs are expected to know their setting and adventure, and should be ready to adapt to player decisions.\n\nIf there are any issues regarding your session, please contact me (Adam Scott). II will always make sure to take care of you.\n\n***About your host:***\nMy name is Adam and I’m a teacher by day and RPG game organizer by night and weekends for people who want to play and learn about the hobby.\nI learned how to play role playing games virtually as soon as I could roll dice and haven't looked back. A huge fantasy and science fiction fan, I've engaged in immersive storytelling for 20+ years, both with friends and in my classroom as a career teacher. All are welcome at my table to learn the basics of role playing games through Dungeons & Dragons. I also provide advice to my community of over 24,000 gamers through my instagram account.\n\nWe look forward to having you at the table.\nAdam Scott\nOwner/Operator/Head GM\nDnD Club\nIG: @the.dnd.club",

Online games are held on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. In person games are held on weekdays (and will be held on any day from Monday to Thursday). \n\nThe group is ideal for folks with a reasonable or good knowledge of the game of Bridge, giving you the opportunity to play casual, fun bridge games.\n\nOnline games are done through the excellent Bridgebase.com website and we can chat verbally (and see each other whilst playing if attendees wish) using WhatsApp or a video calling service (Teams, Zoom or Skype).\nHappy to show you how to use the Bridge Base site before you play in one of our online sessions if you have not played using this site before.\n\nA photo of yourself is required from new members - so we can properly welcome you. Note: This is a private group so photos are not available to non-members. Spectators are welcome at our online events.\n\nMembers may also wish to attend face to face bridge evenings. At the moment these are held in the Ascot (Berks) area, though elsewhere may also be possible. \n\nAny questions please contact David or myself. Hope to welcome you to the group soon!\n\nDave",

We're about having a bit of fun and spending an enjoyable and sociable time doing what we like best; which is ...obviously... gaming. </p> \n<p>Come and enjoy your first meet-up with us for free. After that, we charge £2 on Wednesday nights and £1 on Friday night sessions. The money goes to covering our meetup fees, room hire and any spare goes towards games that can be won or used by members of the group. Tea and coffee is provided on Wednesdays and you can / should buy drinks at the bar on our Friday meets. &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>If you're not a die-hard gamer, don't worry! We have plenty of games to start you off gently.... and are currently running some extra introductory sessions to lead you in gently. Our regular members tend to bring a good selection of games with them...but do try and sign up if you are coming so that we can cater for the right amount of people. </p> \n<p>We never play Monopoly, Scrabble, Cluedo or Backgammon ;-) Chances are however that if you like those, you'll be blown away by the modern games that we adore. We don't have favourite games that get played every single week as we enjoy playing a wide variety of stuff...from quick 5 minute filler games to complex all-evening strategy games and everything in between. Worker placement, area control, deck building, hand management, take-that, tile placement, competitive or co-operative...we really do cater for most board game tastes. Don't worry if you don't know the rules. They will be run through at the start of the game. &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>Any questions or worries? Just send us a message...we will happily answer any queries. We are a friendly bunch so don't be scared ... come and have some gaming fun!</p>",

Events that have less than 3 attendees at the RSVP end time (an hour before the event) are likely to be cancelled.\n4. 3 or more no-shows are cause for a permanent ban from the group. A No-show is someone who RSVPs yes and does not attend the meetup without informing the host either by message/comment/any other means. If you have a +1, that will count as 2 no-shows.\n5. You may be removed from the meetup if you have joined but haven't attended RSVP or tried to attend the meetup for 4 months or more without informing the organizer either by message/comment/any other means. This won't result in a ban.\n\nMeetup costs:\nOwing to the bulging size of the meetup group itself as well as the number of no-shows, the meetups are no longer free. A Nominal charge will be applied to the meetup RSVP to help cover the cost of the meetup as well as for the board games.\nPayment can be made either in cash at the event or to my Monzo bank account [https://monzo.me/muralikrishnakavassery/5.00?d=Board%20Games](https://monzo.me/muralikrishnakavassery/5.00?d=Board%20Games) (Sort code: 04-00-04, customer number: 95376376, Name: Muralikrishna Kavassery, Account type: Personal).

In the meantime, the Discord and the Meetup will remain live. If anyone would like to arrange something using the platforms, please let us know, and if possible, and safe, we will help.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there has been a boom in digital board games across all platforms. We are looking to create a Virtual Meetup to embrace these, but the high cost of many of these games makes that problematic. The Organizers will try and come up with something in the coming weeks/months.</p>\n<p>Until we can meet again as usual, please keep safe, and remember you are not alone. SLBG will return.</p>\n<p>The SLBG Organisers</p>---\n<p>Update - Spring 2020</p>\n<p>In light of the outbreak of COVID-19/the Coronavirus, WE ARE GOING TO CANCEL ALL FORTHCOMING SESSIONS OF THE MEETUP. This was not an easy choice for us to make, but we believe it is the best way to keep everyone safe and healthy. We are not sure when we will restart, as this situation may rumble on for a long time. BUT WE WILL RETURN. We love gaming, and we are proud of the community that came together after Kyle founded the group all those years ago.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the interim, while we will not be running groups, there is the <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/channels/523866954726113282/523866954726113284\">Discord Server</a>, which, if you haven’t joined already, you can join via this <a href=\"https://discord.gg/DY4wXFA\">link</a>. This should allow us to keep in touch, arrange ‘virtual meetups,’ and maybe play some video games together. We will also keep the MeetUp running for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regarding the Coronavirus, please keep an eye on local guidance, but also the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\">World Health Organization’s page</a> on it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We aren’t going anywhere, and when we can, we will meet in person again.

But don't worry if you don't have any - there are always a few of us that get excited and bring along more than we need!</p>\n<p>The games we bring change from week-to-week, covering a wide range of different games, from party games (Werewolf, Secret Hitler, Bang!...) to co-op games (Pandemic, Dead of Winter, Mysterium...) to competitive games where you are trying to beat out your opponents in an all-out quest to victory (Ticket to Ride, Concordia, Great Western Trail).</p>\n<p>We're a really friendly group - everyone is welcome especially if you've never played these kinds of games before.

Our calendar is jam packed with activities, with the intention of having “something for everyone” and nobody gets left behind.\nYou will notice on our rides that we use a colour code system to differentiate the difficulty. To understand this better and to work out which level you are at please read our ability guide here:\nhttps://claphamcycleclub.com/[abilityguide/](https://claphamcycle.com/abilityguide/)\nWe now have over 190 registered members, with 3-4 rides every week, and with multiple trips abroad.\nIn 2019 we completed 256 events in total and for 2020 we aim to complete even more!\nJoin us, meet some new friends, and become a part of the fastest growing cycling community around.\n*Please read out Do's & Donts before attending any of our rides (link below)*\n*[http://www.meetup.com/Clapham-Cycle/pages/Clapham_Cycle_-_Do%27s_and_Don%27ts](http://www.meetup.com/Clapham-Cycle/pages/Clapham_Cycle_-_Do%27s_and_Don%27ts)*\n**Pace Groups**\nWe will never allow more than 10 people in a group, so we if have more than one leader we will split into two or three groups. We will then split the pace the best we can, the faster riders in group 1 and so fourth. So 1 leader equals 10 cyclists, this is why you will see wait-list for a while until another leader confirms.\n**RSVP Rules**\nOur rides are getting very popular, please only RSVP if you are serious about coming. There is nothing worse than having no-shows and then people on the wait list missing out. If you no-show 3 times without 24 hours cancellation notice you will be removed from the group.\n**Use Strava?**\nWe have our own club, please join!

Whether you are looking to improve your group riding skills, get fit, train for a big event, or just looking to meet fellow minded people, then the Rouleurs could be the club for you! \nWe are a non-profit organisation run entirely by volunteers. The club is affiliated with British Cycling and for as little as £35 per year our members get to take part in weekly rides, socials, holidays, training events, etc. If wanting to join as a full member then please go to [http://rprouleurs.co.uk/membership](http://rprouleurs.co.uk/membership). \nOur main ethos is to ride as a group, we stop for punctures, and leave nobody behind. We have many groups out of varying levels with the main purpose of getting back to the pub safely for a few beers with the rest of the team, though most club rides will require you to be able to ride 40-50 miles. If you are concerned about keeping up, then talk to one of our more experienced members.\nWe schedule laps around Richmond Park most Saturdays to encourage new members along. Whether a beginner or an experienced rider, we can find you the right paced group to ride with and meet some of the regulars on a nice leisurely ride.\nDon't forget to check out our [website](http://rprouleurs.co.uk) and social networks on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/richmondparkrouleurs/), [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/RPRouleurs)and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rprouleurs/)!\nWhy not purchase some of our club kit and feel really part of the club!

The aim of the group is to have meetups on a regular basis aiming for members to meet-up at least a couple of times a month. All events endeavour to allow members to get to know each other in an intimate sociable setting to enjoy a feeling of 'friends getting together'. To encourage this, we may limit numbers of attendees for certain events and the group has a cap on the number of members at 40.</p><p><br /></p><p>The membership fee is £10 on joining and then £10 every year paid by standing order to be paid on July 2nd each year – to coincide with Meet Up’s annual fee payment.&nbsp;It is important that you meet up with the group before your membership is approved.</p><p><br /></p><p>All paid-up members automatically become ‘event-organisers’ allowing them to put up events.</p><p><br /></p><p>Events - All members are expected to put up an event at some stage so that everyone appreciates the efforts that go into running the group. However, this is by rotation of members and only one member has to do this each month, so if we have 40 members your turn will only come around every 40 months! Outside of \"your month\",&nbsp;you can put up any number of events you wish, but please consider the day you put up events to avoid clashes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Age range - Membership is limited to the over 45s to encourage common ground amongst the ladies.</p><p><br /></p><p>Photos - When you join ELSG you are asked to include a photo that identifies you. This helps us spot newcomers at events. Some people choose to put up a photo of an inanimate object, which is unhelpful thus we are unable to accept members without a full-face picture.</p><p><br /></p><p>RSVP - Once you decide to attend an event you must RSVP it. This lets the organiser and members know who they should look out for at the event. If no one RSVPs an event, it may be cancelled or rescheduled – so it is not advisable to just turn up without RSVPing! Moreover, if you RSVP an event and fail to turn-up you could leave the host hanging around by themselves – PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE!</p><p><br /></p><p>First-timers - The first time you RSVP an event it is advisable to let the event organiser know this is your first time so they can make sure they look out for you or perhaps exchange numbers with you in case of any last minutes changes. There is a comment box beneath each event where you can enter text which is the best way to liaise with the event organiser.</p><p><br /></p><p>Termination of membership – this is very rare! If you are considerate, friendly (especially to new-comers), non-cliquing, capable, reliable and engage with the ELSG site to keep up with events and notifications then I do not imagine you’ll have any issues :o)</p><p><br /></p><p>ELSG has been running for seven years now and experience has shown us that members who run into difficulties are those who imagine that ELSG is an automated system – it is not, humans run it. It is important that members refer to the site to keep updated on events and news - no one has the time to hold your hand :o(</p><p><br /></p><p>Last and most importantly - overall, we're a friendly group who enjoy a glass or two. If you fancy joining, have no major hang-ups and you’re friendly and enjoy a natter in addition to being a lady of a certain age, then ELSG is possibly the meet-up group for you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope to meet you at an event soon!</p><p><br /></p><p>Maria</p><blockquote><br /></blockquote><blockquote><br /></blockquote>",

All are welcome 🌍\n\nMeet like-minded people for new friendships.\n\nThen come on out and join us for our Free Speed Friending social!\n\nWe arrange for you to meet and chat with each other. This gives you an easy and convenient way to meet new people in a way that completely dissolves barriers. This is NOT speed dating and so you will be meeting both ladies and gentlemen in mixed groups. The intent is to create friendships.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits is that this tears down the walls of shyness. Many people have deep-seated anxiety when it comes to talking to people they don’t know. But when you push outside your comfort zones, this speedy connection opens up the door to allow you to easily communicate and work together with other members of the group.\n\nSpeed friending allows you to identify other people with common interests. The conversations that take place don’t have to be deep, profound or even scripted; simply discussing likes and dislikes may lead to future friendships. Often, people want to make new friends, but they aren’t quite sure how to go about it. With speed friending, you can start pursuing that goal.\n\nHow to participate: Free Events\nDownload the Zoom app for free on a desktop or mobile device.\nAfter you click attend, you'll see the Zoom link to join the event.\n\nWhat happens in the event:\n\n1️⃣ Upon entering the event you will be in our virtual lobby where our event hosts will welcome you.

The meetup is open to professionals living and residing in London, so there are questions to fill in before applying. We will meet inside all the pubs of greater London. Pubs with too strong music or too thematic or little will not be selected, but we will endeavour to get inside all of the pubs. We will endeavour to visit all the pubs of London, so we will meet within the same pub only if the pub is very little and there will be a limited number of spots. In this case the people that have already been at that pub will not be allowed to join again to give to other people the opportunity to see that pub. Every week we will meet inside a certain pub and we will explore a different area only when we have called at all the pubs of the previous one. For example if we start with the pubs in Shepherds Bush we will get to all the pubs within the shepherds Bush area. There will be a charge only for selected meetings.\nPlease note : you don't have to purchase alcohol if you don't want to, the important thing is that you purchase something that appeals to you. At the end of the year or so you can say that you have visited all the pubs of London at least the ones within zone 1 and 2. Please note : we will only go inside public houses. Discos and bars are not included.\nThis Meetup group is not open to un respectful people, and is open to diversity, the attitude of members will be monitored by the organisers that pay the fees. Members will be monitored. Membership of other members requires approval.",

Also note, our meetups will generally be held over the weekends as this is most best for most people and the weekend is the best time to have some fun....Stay blessed. &lt;br&gt;</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>Please note that two No Shows will result in removal from the Group (which no one wants).

        "description": "Welcome to **up-in-the-cheap-seats**. This group aims to bring together people who share a common aim - to *see theatre at reasonable prices*.\nAll are welcome at our events - We've met so many lovely people and everyone has been so friendly and enthusiastic. Group sizes vary so we can meet up before and get a chance to talk to each other. We have a great group of organisers with varied tastes and interests; which keeps our calendar filled with mainstream and more eclectic events.\nWith over **2,200 events** in the 10 years we've been going, the variety of shows we've seen is immense. We see a mixture of musicals, plays, opera, ballet, music, comedians and films and are always open to new suggestions! A calender of our events can be found here: [https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar](https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar)\n**There is a one-off joining fee of £2.50** to be a member of **up-in-the-cheap-seats**. These funds will be used to cover the meetup fees and cover expenses associated with running the group. \n\nPlease note, if you are an inactive member for many months (i.e. if you don't log into the website or don't attend any events), you will be removed from the group as we encourage this group to be as active as possible.\nSo......how does it work? \n\n**We buy our own tickets.** Your event organiser will add a link on the event invitation so you can buy your ticket at the same price that they enjoyed. Obviously the price is not guaranteed especially if the show is popular or you wait a few days before booking.\n\n**Please update your RSVP to confirm that you are joining us.** The organiser will normally add a comment to the event page saying which seat they have purchased. This isn’t mandatory but helps others decide on their seat selection – it is always nice to be sat near or next to another member of the group! The group does not charge to attend individual events (just the one-off £2.50 joining fee). Therefore Meetup states that the event is free. This does not mean that your ticket is free - you will need to purchase this yourself.\n\nThe event host will post the meet up details a day or two before the show.\n\nWe usually meet outside the theatre or in one of the theatre's bars around 30 minutes before the show.\n\nIf there is an interval we will meet up again in the bar at the interval so we can all share our opinion of what we have enjoyed (or not!) so far.\n\nWe will also usually meet up afterwards for a brief chat about the show but sometimes (depending on how late it is and the day of the week), we may go on somewhere for a drink and a longer chat.\n\n**If you are unable to make an event, please change your RSVP** so that your host knows not to wait for you.  \n\nHope to see you at an event soon,\n**Your UITCS Oraganisers**\n\\*Please note, this group does generate a lot of email, but the good news is these settings are customisable, and can easily be changed by going to 'My Profile', then 'Emails' and 'Notifications'.",

We've hosted hundreds of dating events, all across London and pride ourselves on giving our members the perfect opportunity to meet lots of single people, in a safe and welcoming atmosphere.

It seemed impossible to find fun, reasonably priced and most importantly brilliantly hosted singles events. So we decided to host our own and we truly love what we do.\n\nUnlike other meet up groups we are actually a full time run business, with a brand new website and members account area so you can match and message with anyone you meet at one of our events. We also have customer service 7 days a week to handle any questions you may have.\n\nOur speed dating and singles social events are mainly targeted at men and women aged 25- 55 in the London area and are hosted by our professional team. Creating a friendly yet exciting environment, our hosts are there to keep things relaxed yet exciting and help with those all important ice-breakers. They don't just say hi and leave you to it, they'll be there the whole night making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nAnd our True Dating guarantee is if you don't meet at least one person you'd like to match with at any of our events, your next event is completely free!\n\nTo find out more about us and book tickets please check out our website: www.truedating.co.uk",

We will also endeavour to book venues which are accessible for people with mobility issues, and will make it clear in the event description whether the venue is accessible.\n\nAs we are starting out, we may need to try out several different venues to find one that works well.

Whether it's a particular genre of music/club night/dancing,  theatre/acting, food, singing/rockaoake, sports/fitness, comedy, art, pub crawls, cutting edge science, spirituality actvities - we host free fun themed events to ensure only like minded people with the same passions get to meet and particpate as life is too short to spend time with people who do not excite and or engage you.\n\nOur membership is biased towards successful but unpretentious career professionals with highly engaging personalities who are are socially skilled, outgoing, intellectually curious and creative with outstanding sense of humour! We value quality over mediocrity so attempt to constrict attendees to people with an authentic love of the event theme to both foster good engagement dynamics & keep attendees to a manageable size.\n\nOur London events are hosted by a born Londoner who know the city and hidden gems inside out! We also avoid holding events in touristy/sleazy venues so attendees get to enjoy authentic London venues & experiences and meet native brits anf form long lasting connections easily. Typical past events have included stargazing, rockaoke, music themed clubbing events (80s, 90s, 70s, 50s, Hip Hop & Reggae nights), sports events (badminton, rounders, tennis), Halloween pub crawls/tours, exhibitions, dinners/food tasting/supper club, lunches/brunch, coffee, firework displays, talks/seminars, concerts - you name it - we've done it!\n\nWaiting lists wise - when places become available, preference will be given to people with complete profiles who can demonstrate a genuine passion for the event theme, to the most loyal members and those with a close proximity to event location so it is parmount you fill out your profile!!\n\nAnd here at Chillout, our philosophy is you shouldn't have to pay a premium to enjoy the things that you love so in accordance with the fundamental founding tenet of Meetup - the vast majority of our events are free - no profit motive here! However in rare cases, where direct or venue hiring costs are incurred for putting on a specific event, there maybe a small charge.\n\nSo, whether you’re originally from London or brand new to the city, here's to enjoying some memoriable crazy times out with a select audience and even forming strong new authentic long lasting connections along the way.\n\nLucas - Founder & Organiser (and essay writer!)\n***Please note, if you are identified to having different motives for attending events other than for socialising around a shared theme that you are truly passionate about or found to be harassing members or seeking sexual conquests you will be removed. For security screening and protecting our members - everyone must have a full face pic prior to attending an event so they can be indentified in the case of any issues. If any ladies recieve unsolicited contact from random people they have never met please feel free to report to me (so I can remove) and contact meetup site directly.*** \n\nFeel free to follow us on Twitter to Keep updated with new events here:\nhttps://twitter.com/Chillout_London\nhttps://twitter.com/LucasBulsara\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nAnd now for some blatant testimonial marketing (generous bank transfers on way):\n\n\"His energy, event passion, beauty and brief conversation shifted my mindset tremendously in less than a few minutes which is very rare when attending meetups\" Clare\n\n\"I went to Chillout London when I was new to the city from the USA and I always had a really great time. Everyone was super friendly. Lucas always has cool captivating themes and I always felt deeply engaged, never bored. I would definitely recommend!\" Staci Schidmt\n\n\"The organiser is late often and as a former teacher I have no idea how he made it through school or university without being expelled but his events are so novel & addictive I just can't stay away\" Reena Teacher\n\n\"Meeting Lucas and attending his event was a lovely experience. He had so much knowledge and passion. It was really good. Very impressive\" Komal\n\n\"It's about time Lucas grew up, got a girlfriend/got married like the rest of his mates instead of wasting his time on this meetup nonsense. He should be hanging out with his real friends!\" Adam Joslin\n\n\"The organiser is one of the funniest entertaining people I've met. He is really passionate about all his event themes and so there is always an air of excitement and never a dull moment. Now I'm a semi regular - I always leave either learning something new or laughing on the way home\"  Lorraine Norton\n\n\"Organiser jokes around a lot but I love him. When he was DJing at his club event party he refused to play Never Tear Us Apart for me so if you like good music I suggest you avoid Chillout events\" Dominika Abel (Assitant Organiser)",

It has never been.\n\nWe need developers to help save water and energy, and prolong the lives of both humans and animals. The list of challenges is too long to list all of them here.\n\nHowever, it takes months to find a suitable developer for a project, even in the world of finance, where money is not the biggest problem. Now try to imagine, how hard may it be for nature-related projects, like NationalTrust (UK), Greenpeace, and many others.\n\nThat is where we help. We help people of any degree of IT proficiency to get into OpenSource. We help people to become a true part of the Open Source Community. Our goal is to help them to impact society in the most positive way, while quickly and powerfully progressing their IT skills. \n\nOur goal is not to grow the “alike developers”, but rather to help each person to realize this individual’s strengths and build on these.\nEvery single person with the most basic IT knowledge can contribute to OpenSource, a lot.\n\nNo coding skills are actually required. Numerous roles in Open Source do not require coding skills.\nAlso, you might notice that your coding skills will just appear, at some point in the future ;)\n\nWe need to give this world a chance.\n\nWe need more contributors.\n**We need YOU.**",

Some events are Free Entry and some are paid gigs with a cheap Guest-List. It's a group for friends to meet people and organise nights out together :)\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nThe Live Music Industry is unfortunately not what it used to be 20 years ago - Nowadays, an Artist is judged on how many ‘Likes’ and ’Thumbs-Up’ they can get on a Facebook page…\n\nWe live in London the MUSIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\n\nIf you don’t believe that there are amazing nights of music playing all-night long, then you haven’t been paying attention.\n\nI am offering any Band or Artist currently performing around London an Instagram ‘Follow’ if they want it. I have lived here all my life and I know great music events happen everyday because I’ve been there, seen it and I am happy to support it. Last year has probably been the hardest for many Musicians - Nearly all the best Live Music Venues have closed down - BIG RED / LOCK TAVERN / THE MONARCH and many others. Most Alternative Music has been pushed to East LONDON and It's pretty hard getting gigs. So, I will be hosting a few MUSICIANS MEETUPS and I welcome anyone playing music or searching for fellow musicians to come down for a drink 🙂🍻\n\nOver the last 5 years of running this Group, I have had a lot of people come and express an interest in meeting other musicians to form bands. It’s difficult meeting the right people so if you are a Singer, Guitarist, Bassist or Drummer, have a band or think there’s anything we might be interested in then this might be a good group for you.\nWe put on our own nights and are always looking for great bands to see around London. If you are looking for Gigs or reliable promoters, then we can probably help point you in the right direction.\n\nAt the very least, we can talk music and then watch some bands :)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nWe are not responsible for you or your belongings. By attending events you agree to waiver liability for the Host :) Please bring ID to all events 18+ Thank you",

If you fancy a trip to an art gallery, a walk in the woods, or a chat over dinner where you can connect with more people, you have come to the right place.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Our regular Monthly Meet ups include:</span></p>\n<p><span>A monthly Supper Club that tours the eateries of East London. Hosted by Róisín and Mel.</span></p>\n<p>A monthly gathering to see the drag show 'Drag Out the Weekend' at the Northcote pub in Leyton/Leytonstone.&nbsp; A space to catch up with other ELL members, enjoy great gastro pub food and watch a different drag act each month.

Obviously, this excludes emergencies. We just ask you let us know in good time that you can't come.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We encourage members to host events that they are interested in and we would be delighted to support you if you wish to host an event that interests you in an area/venue you're familiar with.

NPD is rarely diagnosed, as the narcissist believes “there’s nothing wrong with me and it’s everybody else who is at fault. It's usually the victim that presents at therapy. If you’ve been around someone who gaslights you, has frightening rages at perceived slights, you feel like you are walking on eggshells, belittles you, is very controlling, has delusions of grandeur, thinks they are better than everyone else, creates a smear campaign against you if you question their character, has a charming/caring side to the outside world which makes you question your sanity and beliefs, you have very possibly encountered someone with NPD.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The abuse is insidious and erodes the victim's sense of self, you feel trapped in the FOG (fear, obligation and guilt) you know there is something very wrong but make excuses to justify the emotionally manipulative abuse. </p><p>The journey from discovery to recovery can be very frightening, isolating and extremely difficult to articulate to anyone who has been fortunate enough not to have encountered a narcissist.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>A fellow survivor wrote \"I fully understand the roller coaster of emotions and sense of isolation we can experience, as we are often called crazy, hyper-sensitive and gaslighted along the way. I believe a key part of the healing process is to exchange personal stories with those who have an understanding of the pain that narcissistic abuse can cause. This validation is often of vital importance in our recovery process from narcissistic abuse\". I absolutely second that statement and hence the beginning of Discovery to Recovery of Narcissistic Abuse support group.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this group can help give you comfort from knowing you are not alone and you are not going crazy! We are here to support you along the road from discovery to recovery to thriving, from this insidious, misunderstood, personality disorder.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Sarah J x&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>*** Please ensure your profile title has a first name and surname or initial so that co organisers can identify members.***&nbsp;</p>",

Come on then ladies lets build a Circle of Friends!\nOccasionally some venues are small so numbers will be restricted, we normally have a waiting list for these events in case someone can't make it, so click on the rsvp anyway and that will add you to the wait list, and check back near the time to see if you have been added to the event.\nSo you can't find something to fit in with your commitments, why not host an event?

However, if you don’t live in that area you can still request to join if able to travel to and from events.\n\nIf you are 40+ and looking for new friends and things to do why not give us a try?\n\nTheatre has always been a key aspect of our group and we have been to numerous performances over the years since the group started in June 2016. We have had some challenging times during the Covid Pandemic but we are now beginning to look at putting on more events as people begin to venture back out on the social scene.\n\nApart from Theatre our events can be anything from comedy nights, party breaks, quiz nights, outings, music nights, cinema, meals out, walks, guided tours, picnics, informal parties etc.\n\nThe extent and number of events will depend on what people are prepared to offer to the group. The organisers are not able to do everything so we are particularly interested in new members who are willing/able to host/organise events.\n\nWe appreciate not everyone is comfortable with uploading a face photo but this is preferred if possible as it does help with identification when meeting up for events (especially new people). However, if you prefer just add a photo of anything to get through the photo required section.\n\nAlso with new members there is an admin/joining fee required (currently £5 for individual membership or £10 for plus one membership) to go towards MeetUp fees.\n\nEncore: Theatre and Events for Friends to Enjoy is a Closed Group (acceptance for membership is at the discretion of organisers subject to availability). Please do not be offended should it not be possible to accept a request to join. This is more likely if you already belong to 10 or more other MeetUps as we are looking for active members and if you already belong to loads of other groups that's unlikely. If accepted you will need to attend at least one event every year (but hopefully you will want to join us at many more that). Current members can also recommend people to join the group.\n \nWe hope you will enjoy being a part of Encore and if you have an idea for a show or event please let me know and we will investigate, or better still have a go and organise it yourself as it will be possible to add extra organisers to Meetup.",

Friends, collaborators, romantic partners....There is potential for all types of healthy connection, because...\n\n***Through Deep Connection, Anything Is Possible!***\n\nWhen we interact without bias or neediness, we open the door to all possibilities. You'll have the opportunity to do that while learning how to connect far deeper than you may realise you are capable of.\n\nHere, we won't just talk, we get to the depths of our souls quickly. We connect while removing the crap that often gets in the way.\n\nJoin in with the interactive talks and workshops. You will learn, grow and connect. As the community grows there will be more immersive events and activities. The more you show up and interact, the more we will get happening.\n\nYou may recognise the name of this group. Deep Connections London is a group I originally created 6 years ago. I co-facilitated it with a friend for 2 years. We had over 3000 members and hosted around 400 events - Talks, workshops, all day challenges and retreats. It was THE place to connect deeply in the heart of London.\nI am proud of what we did, and of our members who kept showing up to further their journey into deeper connection.\n\nWe closed the group because our lives needed to go in different directions, but I never stopped missing our members or my events. I know that many will benefit from living a more deeply connected life..myself included... So, I'm bringing it back and expanding it throughout the UK and beyond.\n\nI can't wait to meet you and embark on this beautiful adventure!\n\n*With Passion, Purpose and Love*\n\n*David Saville*",

If you want to join us, you only have to enjoy cycling, getting fitter and making friends. Oh, and you need a road bike! </span></p><p><span>This cycling club is for all levels from beginners to advanced. So whether you need help using your gears effectively or want to train competitively and enter sportives with us, RPV is the group for YOU! </span></p><p><span>The ethos of the club is collaborative and considerate riding – the team is stronger than the individual. Have a look through our </span><a href=\"https://richmondparkvelo.com/club-ride-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">Club Ride Rules</a><span> to see what we aspire to. No one is perfect but we all share the aim to improve!</span></p><p><span>While some of the members race outside the club environment, we discourage racing on club rides where the stronger riders are expected to help the less strong ones by doing more work at the front rather than riding “off the front”. We regroup after hills and stop for mechanicals and punctures.</span></p><p><span>Members are given a ranking – Steady/Steady+/Intermediate/Intermediate+/Advanced to ensure that the riders in each group on a club ride are, so far as possible, of the same standard. Click here for more information on our </span><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Richmond-Park-Velo-cycling-club/pages/24915364/WHAT_DOES_MY_RANKING_MEAN/\" target=\"_blank\">ranking system</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>All our ride leaders ascribe to the same values of collaborative and considerate riding and offer constructive criticism and encouragement.

We ask all members to wear at least a club jersey on club rides.</span></p><p><span>So, what’s in it for you? Loads! </span></p><p><span>We give beginners tips to on how to ride efficiently and improve their hill-climbing and help intermediate cyclists move up to the next level by developing their group riding skills ie. their ability to ride collaboratively as a team. </span></p><p><span>We hold regular Skills Sessions where you can learn drafting and communication skills in a safe environment. </span></p><p><span>We organise cycle rides along many different routes in Surrey, Kent, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. </span></p><p><span>See what weekly rides and other events we offer here: </span><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Richmond-Park-Velo-cycling-club/events/calendar\" target=\"_blank\">Calendar</a></p><p><span>Sunday Club rides are typically 50 miles for Steadies; 50 to 60 miles for Inters and 60 to 70 miles for Inter+ and Advanced. All our club rides involve a break at the half way point for a coffee and a sandwich.

Are the sessions suitable for Beginners?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so beginners will at least learn the short answers to questions like: 'what's your favorite food and where can I get it?' 'Chinese food at China Town!' From then, you can slowly build up your repertoire.\n\n**2\\. Are the sessions suitable for intermediate/advanced speakers?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so no matter what level you are at, you will be able to practice it to your level.\n\n**3\\. Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?**\nNo, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for at least half the session with our 'Speed-chatting' format!\n\n**About the host**\nChina Unbound hosts this meetup.

The absolute basic requirement of all members is therefore to ensure that you keep your RSVPs up to date. If you put your name down to attend an event and later cannot make it, you need to be fair to all parties involved and click on ‘Edit your RSVP’ to ‘Not going’ ahead of the event.

        "description": "Welcome!\nThis group has morphed from where it initially started which was an invitation to explore Hidden London. I have made a decision that every year the group will focus on a different way to explore our beautiful city and connect to likeminded people.\n\nFollowing the last 2 years of Covid and restrictions, it is only natural that we now all value the simpler things in life we might have taken for granted before, more deeply.\n\nI am inviting you to see your life, your world with new eyes....\nI am inviting you to become an explorer in your own city.\nAn explorer in the world.\nAn explorer with yourself and others.\nI invite you to awaken awe and playfulness and see what happens....\n\nWhether you have just moved to London or have lived here all your life, or if you live outside of London but always wanted to explore the forgotten or hidden parts of London, while meeting new people then this invitation is for you, if deep down inside you have an adventurer and explorer waiting to come out! All adults are welcome.\n\nI will be running a variety of events: my aim is to put events together that will unite people to come together in this amazing city (and sometimes even venture further afield!) and just have fun. And in the process slow down to really take in the beauty that is life and make magic moments. \n\n\n\n\n**IS THIS GROUP FOR YOU?**\nThis is for you if you are an adventurer/explorer at heart, you are open to new experiences, curious, energetic and enthusiastic about life and living in London and interested in exploring it in different ways. For me the lure of setting up this group wasn't just about getting out the house to see the city I have lived in for so many years but rather to explore London, in a new and exciting way! And it goes much deeper than that: it's about creating a sense of novelty, awe and wonder about our lives and our surroundings. For all we think we know so well and there's nothing left to discover, once we decide we are at heart \"intrepid explorers\" in our own lives and in our own city then we can choose to see everything around us with curiosity and fresh eyes and a renewed sense of wonder. It's an almost child like ability of playfulness, that we tend to lose as we become adults. This is what I hope to achieve with this group: recapture our sense of playfulness, discovery and wonder, while making connections with others! The magical moments happen when we are brave enough to explore and then make a connection with others on the same path!\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE:**\nI spent years working in top 5 star hotels as a Concierge so I got to know all the secret places that few people know about in London. In addition to that I have a passion for London and it's unique character and all the gems it hides in plain sight!I have escorted some friends and even business clients through London and they all loved how they were shown parts of London they didn't expect to see, and how much they enjoyed it! I am now also a Life Coach and Healer, so I love the idea of connecting people especially now following an extended period of Covid that will have affected our mental health and ability to connect with others. \n\nPlease feel free to drop me a line and suggest any events/activities you would like to take part in...all suggestions are welcome!",

The aim is to embrace and breathe in new life post lockdown (which let's face it was an all round shitty time for everyone). So lets get together meet new people, build new connections and have fun, in a warm, chill, pretense free environment. The events will be a mixture of relax, tame and chill Vs rambunctious, tumultuous and late. A bit of something for everyone ;)",

        "description": "<p>WYBTD (Will You Be There Darling?): Gay Men Who Wanna Have Fun</p><p>A free all-encompassing Meetup group for gay men who like to go out, be entertained and socialise. No more missing out on fun events because you have no-one to go with or are reluctant to go alone.</p><p>Covering all tribes from the pretentious culture vultures to the unapologetic trashy queens and everyone in between. Whether you are single, partnered or polyamorous there is something for everyone! We don't believe in gender stereotypes (such as masc/fem) or slut-shaming or body-shaming. We are all 'good gays' just maybe some are more shy or socially anxious than others.</p><p>All Meetups are organised by a friendly host whose prime responsibility is to ensure all new members are welcomed, introduced to the group and not excluded. We have very quickly built a great reputation for making everyone feel comfortable and welcome.</p><p>We don’t believe in boxes, labels or tribes - we are all QUEER! We welcome all MSM (men who have sex with men) regardless of where you belong on the GBTQ+ spectrum. So you are welcome to join us regardless of your social background, income, colour, ethnicity, disability, HIV status, size, age, shape or even hairiness. None of us are equal until ALL of us are equal.</p><p><br /></p><p>We have been called the “non-judgemental” Meetup group and we are rather proud of that!&nbsp;We love ‘teenagers of all ages’ but we also love queers who want to act either their age or even older, which is why we have events for all ages and personalities. So let’s go out and do more things that make you forget to check your phone!</p><p>We believe in disconnecting (at least temporarily!) from our mobile-enabled, click-bait geo-social networks and reconnecting in a meaningful way through face-to-face socialising instead. After all, we live in our brilliant London culture bubble, where we're used to having access to the crème de la crème of entertainment every night of the week, so let's take advantage of it!</p><p>We organise Meetup events of all kinds such as art galleries, cabaret, cinema, comedy, dance, museums, music concerts, spoken word poetry and theatre - as well as clubbing nights, cruising bars, drag shows and even sex parties!</p><p>A typical weekend's activities might look like this:</p><p>Friday: WYBTD Social in a private members club in Soho</p><p>Saturday: Art gallery in the afternoon. Off-West End play or independent cinema in the evening, followed by Clubbing</p><p>Sunday: Brunch, comedy cabaret afternoon at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern followed by Horse Meat Disco at the Eagle.</p><p>So regardless of whether you prefer Hard On or Kylie (or both at the same time!) join one of the most all inclusive Meetup groups for gay men.</p><p>Here is an article about WYBTD published recently by Gay Star News:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/will-you-darling-meetup-london/#gs.972e1z\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/will-you-darling-meetup-london/#gs.972e1z</a></p><p>Here is a discussion thread for members to write some short comments about their first time experiences with WYBTD: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/discussions/5665472998014976/chat/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/discussions/5665472998014976/chat/</a></p><p>If you need to know more - check out the testimonials on the 'group reviews' section here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/about/comments/?op=all\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/about/comments/?op=all</a></p><p>WYBTD's founder and main host, Michael, is a veteran of over 1,700 Meetup events!

        "description": "Hi! We are a friendly active group mainly for people interested in golf, snooker, table tennis, and occasionally a few other sports/activities (e.g. cycling). Golf events are generally held in east Berkshire or north west Surrey, whilst other activities are mostly held in Ascot, Sunningdale or Windlesham.\n\nWomen and men of any age are welcome at our events (see also ' more details' below). Having fun doing sports or activities, whilst perhaps making some friends are the main aims of the group. Please ensure you have a photo of yourself when joining so that we can recognise you and welcome you when attending events (note: photos are only visible to members). Hope to see you soon!\n\nMore details:\n\n* Golf - organised most weekends (in Sunningdale, Ascot, or at one of several other nearby courses mainly in east Berkshire and north west Surrey) - usually over 18 holes (but at least once a month over nine). Further details lower down on this page.\n* Table tennis - at least once a month - for players of varied ability up to low league standard (though not suitable for complete beginners) - held at Charters leisure centre, Sunningdale\n* Snooker (or Pool) (at Lavender park, Ascot - during the week or at the weekend). Some experience needed for snooker.\n* Other sports/activities: Cycle rides (leisurely and on quiet roads or off-road) are organised occasionally (in Windlesham or Windsor Great park). Trips to watch sports or to play petanque may also be organised.\n* Please say on your profile which of our regular and occasional activities you are interested in! *Note: Badminton used to be organised (and coaching may still be available), but there is at least three other meetup groups in the area who regularly do this sport (plus some 'no strings badminton') further details available from Dave or David).*\n\n*• Note: If you are interested in bridge locally and online please go to: [https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/) .*\n\nThere are a roughly equal number of men and women in the group, and members are of various ages from 20's to over 60.\nTemporary local residents or visitors to the area from other parts or the country or from overseas are welcome to join if they regularly come to the area or before a visit.\n\\*If the group is 'full' there may be a delay in accepting you in to the group (but this will be done as soon as possible).\n\\*\\*If you are interested in organising a certain activity please contact Dave.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\\*\\*: Golf details: Events are organised at Courses\\* to suit experienced, intermediate and improver players mainly. Cost usually £25 to £40 (for 18 holes). The area has some attractive and quite challenging golf courses. Novice golfers are recommended to come to golf at Lavender Park, Blackwater Valley or Billingbear Park. Other courses that we go to are largely only suitable for more experienced players. The golf courses we visit often or sometimes are Sunningdale Heath, Billingbear Park, Chobham, Downshire, Lavender Park, Pine Ridge, Sand Martins, Mill Ride, Royal Ascot, Sherfield Oaks, Hennerton, Hoebridge, Theale, Sutton Green, Pyrford Lakes and Blackwater Valley.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nNotes:\n\\*: For 2022 there is a SMALL annual membership charge for active group members (at least), but there is no charge for your first event with the group (if done in the first two years of membership).\n\\*\\*: To keep the membership list up to date; because we have a maximum number of members, probably have a waiting list, and possibly to save money on meetup fees, a FEW/SOME inactive members only who have not paid the annual membership fee may be messaged to check they are still interested and active on Meetup (and if no response removed) or removed:\na) members who have not looked at our meetup site in their first 12 months of membership since the day they joined; or\nb) members who have been a member for less than two years, not looked at our meetup site for a year and who have not done any events; or\nc) members who have been a member for at least two years, who have not done any events, and who have not looked at our site for at least six months, or\nd) any member who has attended events before, who has not done any events in their last 3 years of membership and not looked at our meetup site for at least 12 months.\n*\\*\\*\\*Members removed can re-join on payment of the small membership fee. You can live a long way away, but please consider how busy you are on other activities and how far you live or work from the area and whether you will be able to attend events occasionally, before you re-join (note: we rarely do online events).*",

There are lesser days though and still some off road where we enjoy the countryside and take things a little slower.

Come and enjoy the company by talking to friendly strangers and making new friends.</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>Not sure what's going on in the group photo, but it looks like Colin's taking the knee and Mike's apparently been caught rifling his rucksack, although both parties have declined to comment.</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>Please be early as we like to set off fairly on time and can only wait 10 minutes.  </p><p>Don’t forget to cancel via the “Edit RSVP”button if you can’t make a walk.</p><p>Messaging other members without permission will result in being removed from the group.</p>",

Some events are Free Entry and some are paid gigs with a cheap Guest-List. It's a group for friends to meet people and organise nights out together :)\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nThe Live Music Industry is unfortunately not what it used to be 20 years ago - Nowadays, an Artist is judged on how many ‘Likes’ and ’Thumbs-Up’ they can get on a Facebook page…\n\nWe live in London the MUSIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\n\nIf you don’t believe that there are amazing nights of music playing all-night long, then you haven’t been paying attention.\n\nI am offering any Band or Artist currently performing around London an Instagram ‘Follow’ if they want it. I have lived here all my life and I know great music events happen everyday because I’ve been there, seen it and I am happy to support it. Last year has probably been the hardest for many Musicians - Nearly all the best Live Music Venues have closed down - BIG RED / LOCK TAVERN / THE MONARCH and many others. Most Alternative Music has been pushed to East LONDON and It's pretty hard getting gigs. So, I will be hosting a few MUSICIANS MEETUPS and I welcome anyone playing music or searching for fellow musicians to come down for a drink 🙂🍻\n\nOver the last 5 years of running this Group, I have had a lot of people come and express an interest in meeting other musicians to form bands. It’s difficult meeting the right people so if you are a Singer, Guitarist, Bassist or Drummer, have a band or think there’s anything we might be interested in then this might be a good group for you.\nWe put on our own nights and are always looking for great bands to see around London. If you are looking for Gigs or reliable promoters, then we can probably help point you in the right direction.\n\nAt the very least, we can talk music and then watch some bands :)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nWe are not responsible for you or your belongings. By attending events you agree to waiver liability for the Host :) Please bring ID to all events 18+ Thank you",

Topics are expressed not as a question, but as a proposal that the audience must vote to accept or reject after hearing all the arguments.",

We are a really friendly, welcoming bunch!\n\n\n\n\nWe have a great group of organisers, of varying ages, all of whom bring very different life experiences and perspectives to the mix.  In 2022 we are combining Sapphists Hertfordshire with Hitchin Sapphic Socials, and have added a mid Herts event organiser, so we hope you can find something for you not too far from home.  During the last couple of years, spurred on by the desire to address social isolation amongst our Herts LGBTQ+ community, we have enjoyed pub and meal nights, picnics, beach volleyball, book groups, walks, theatre trip, Hertfordshire Pride, North Herts Pride picnic etc.  Some great friendships have developed between some members, and we have been supportive just by being there for each other.\n\n\n\n\nWe hope that the group will grow and develop over time so please do chat to us about your ideas. If there is something you would like to see as part of this group then let us know.\n\n\n\n\nWe look forward to meeting you soon!\n\nEvent Organiser Jacqui - Living in Brighton for almost 15 years I always felt part of a community as LGBTQ+ is part of the fabric of the city. It felt different when I moved to Hitchin so I started a local group to help people feel connected to a wider community and have fun!\n\n\n\n\nGroup Organiser Gillian - After discovering I am lesbian in my 40s/50s, I met and married a woman and moved to another county.  Returning alone to Watford a few years ago, I began to realise I had absolutely no connection with women who love women here!  I joined Meetup and Facebook groups, have enjoyed some great events, and have made many valuable new friends.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Organiser Sharon - I joined the group to socialise with like minded people and have made some lovely new friends.  I’ve enjoyed various nights out with the Sapphists ladies, from meals out, karaoke, book clubs, music to Prides.  Lots of fun and laughter to be had.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Organiser Jenny - I realised I was gay later than most people my age and then felt like I was the only gay in the village.  It seemed like all Lesbian/Bi events were in London and there was nothing in the countryside.  Going to my first LGBTQ+ Meetup was a game changer for me and this group has played a wonderful part in my journey.  So for me helping organise events is my way of paying it forward.  You couldn’t ask for a nicer group of people.",

We are not an Open Mic. Meet-up is just one platform we use and we currently trial Meet-up to see whether this is worth continuing with.**\n\n**What we do at events:** We are a new independent start-up! Acoustic Music is core to our emotional well-being, down the the rhythm of our heartbeat. We promote being well and healthy through music and developing a small local community of budding musicians who are otherwise isolated and disconnected from growing with other musicians.\n\n2 hours long acoustic music sessions limited to a max of 8 musicians. We work on shared and agreed music repertoire and play as an ensemble or session. We have our own performance space and audience in the acoustic cafe coffeehouse style.\n\nWe currently run 5 acoustic music meet ups:\n\n**1\\. Classical Chamber Meet\\-up: Saturdays 3\\.00pm \\[sessional depending on players\\]**\n**2\\. Singer\\-Songwriter Indie Alternative Session: Saturdays 5\\.00pm**\n**3\\. Alt\\. Folk Acoustic Session: Wednesday 6\\.00pm**\n**4\\. London Chinese Music Instrument Music Meetup: Sundays 2\\.00pm \\[Private\\]**\n**5\\. World Music \\[Acoustic instruments only\\] Meet up \\[NEW\\]: Sundays 2pm** \n\n**1\\. Classical Music & Chamber Music Meet\\-up:** If you know your way around your classical instrument (cello, violin, flute, clarinet etc), and are interested in meeting like minded instrumentalists to grow and nurture classical ensemble playing- drop us a message with your instrument and repertoire interest! We work out scores with parts we can rehearse and put together.\n\n**2\\. Acoustic Indie Alternative Sessions:** Unlike Open Mics, we work around each others' songs and songwriting, traditional folk and original songs creating instrument parts from the collective of musicians. By alternative, we refer to the spirit of alternative music in its non-commercial, non-saccharin lyrics and non-pop structure.\n\n**3\\. Alt\\. Folk:** we started off performing as folk musicians and love folk music by T Bone Burnett, Wovenhand, Jason Isbell and the Indigo Girls. We play loosely and openly embrace new twists and turns to folk music. We're definitely not oldtimer style!\n\n**4\\. London Chinese Music Instrument Meet up:** Private session. Interested players committed to performing and long term playing are welcome to enquire. From time to time we invite new members.\n\n**5\\. World Music \\[Acoustic\\] Meet up:** open to anyone who plays or sings (ethnic) world music acoustically. First meeting scheduled for Sunday 3rd May 2022 @ 2pm\n\n**Email: thefilmatelierse6@gmail.com**",

Come and join the adventure and find out why hiking has taken off!\n\n**See all of our events listed by type:**\n\nDAY HIKES:\nhttps://outdooraholics.co.uk/hikesbygrade.pdf\n\nUK WEEKEND TRIPS:\nhttps://outdooraholics.co.uk/weekendtriplist.pdf\n\nFOREIGN TRIPS & HOLIDAYS:\nhttps://outdooraholics.co.uk/foreigntriplist.pdf\n\n**Who we are**\nA group of people dedicated and committed to making the great outdoors more accessible to everyone. With over **44,000 members**, we have now **organised over 1,700 hiking trips** including day walks, weekend hiking trips and an increasing range of foreign hiking trips travelling to Europe and beyond for adventure travel holidays. We target ourselves at the 25 to 49 age group (or young at heart) and whilst most members are within this age group, we do welcome anyone over the age, as well as keeping fit hiking is a great way to make new like minded friends.\nBetween our 3 most senior hike leaders we have over 50 years of experience of leading hikes across the UK as well as an ever increasing range of international trips and tours. We have every corner of the UK covered from Snowdonia in Wales to the Lake District, the great Scottish Highlands and even the far off corners like Cornwall.\nPlease do take a look at our (over 400) independent group reviews:\n[http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all](http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all)\n\nWe have 47 different day and weekend trips that have all been pre hiked and meticulously planned. We organise all the logistics for our hiking trips so that you can just turn up, walk and have a great time and meet new people while enjoying the great outdoors.\n\nIf you enjoy hiking and are based in the UK and looking to meet new like minded friends, Outdooraholics is for you and we look forward to welcoming you to the group!\n\n**Who attends our events?**\nWe're mainly in our mid 20s to mid 40s, but age is no barrier as long as you are young at heart and over 18.\n\nMost of our members generally either live or work in London, although we have people from all over the UK attending and we've had several people visit from abroad for our trips and join us at our destination. After all you don't need to live in London to visit Cornwall, Wales or the Lake District!\n\nWe have a lot of international members - either here on work placements or to live and this brings a superb cultural variety and mix of life experiences to the group and helps to make our trips so interesting and diverse.\n\nWe get a lot of people who attend their first event on their own and we always go out of our way to make everyone very welcome on our trips. They have proven to be a great way to meet people and make new friends as well as to see this wonderful island\n\n**Can I really turn up alone?**\nYes of course - most people do! Please don't be nervous about attending your first event - we have all been in the same boat at some point of turning up at an event alone and knowing nobody. To help introduce people to the group and indeed hiking we have designed 27 different hiking day trips which are a superb way to come and meet the group and we can assure you of a very warm welcome whatever event you choose and there are bound to be others who are attending their first event too. Hiking is a great way of meeting like minded people and making new friendships whilst keeping fit and seeing wonderful places too.\nIf you are nervous about committing to a weekend trip, please don't be, almost everyone has turned up to an event before without knowing anyone and we all know what it's like. To help new members into the group we run 4 to 6 day trips a month which are an easy and low cost way to try our events.\n\n**What hiking trips do we organise?**\n**Day hikes**\nWe organise typically 6 to 8 day hiking trips a month and have 27 tried and tested routes that we use from London. All are pre walked and are picturesque routes that we carefully choose. All trips leave from a central London station and we arrange train tickets, so you can just turn up and enjoy a great day out with us.\n\n**Weekend hiking trips**\nWe organise 3 to 6 weekend trips a month to all corners of the UK, showing you the very best that this country has to offer. We typically rent an entire Youth Hostel just for our group and after a great days hiking then either go to a local restaurant or cook at the hostel. We have over 18 different weekend trips and are adding new ones all the time!\nWe have a professionally trained chef who joins many of our trips and we regularly visit all of the UK's National Parks and designated \"Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\"\n\n**Trips abroad**\nWe offer an ever increasing variety of trips from 3 nights up to a week and will be having a number of new trips added in 2022. Where possible we aim for twin bed rooms and put the meticulous planning into our foreign trips so that you can have a great time and get to see the best of the area that you're visiting. It is a legal requirement (as well as advisable for safety) in many foreign mountainous locations to have an internationally qualified guide and for many of our foreign trips we have a local or native speaking guide.\n\nWhat else do we organise?\n\n**Socials**\nAs well as walking trips, we organise several pub socials per year in central London locations as well as discount nights at outdoor stores in central London.\nWe do focus on the outdoor events more than socials but we can recommend a good social group who do the following events:\nPub crawls, social events, wine tastings, sightseeing, making new friends, dining adventure, new in town drinks, food and cooking related events, exploring London's night life, social drinks, 18s, Go Ape, Treasure Hunts, Go Karting and Paintball\n\n**Outdoor activities**\nWe've been offering multi activity weekends for several years and have both offered or will be bringing the following activities to our weekends - some in London and some that we have to travel to:\nSky diving, coasteering, camping, canoeing and hiking weekends, horse riding, paragliding, parachute jumping, pot holing, yoga breaks, fitness weekends, SCUBA, travel, sightseeing, travelling abroad, indoor and outdoor rock climbing, skydiving, cycling, trekking, backpacking, yoga breaks and tours, holiday getaway breaks, travelling, adventure weekends, sailing, coast walking, long distance walking, caving, fitness weekends, hiking abroad, rock climbing, Go Ape, zip wires, navigation training, historic sightseeing, countryside conservation, overseas trips, the 3 (three) peaks challenge, tennis, hiking and abseiling, go karting, exercise and activity weekends for hikers, treasure hunts, paintball, photograpy exhibitions, treasure and scavenger hunts around London, Paint-ball, charity trips and charity adventure nights with Hope for Homes, badminton, squash, recreation weekends, gorge walking, navigation courses, culture trips, community trips, sea kayaking, kayaking along the Thames, via ferrata walks, orienteering, sailing, exercise boot camps, target shooting and clay pigeon shooting, shopping discount evenings at Cotswold Outdoors.

We take your safety and the great reputation of our yoga/hiking trips very seriously and we only ever use professional full time yoga instructors. We also typically have a professional chef to ensure we have wonderful, healthy and revitalising food. We follow the same great formula as with our hiking weekends - great organisation, great home cooked food, pre planned and hiked routes and highly experienced hike leaders and using hostels allows us to do this at a great price too. We look forward to bringing you an even more expanded range of Yogaholics trips as we enter our 4th year of these Yogaholics trips in 2015!\nWe have created a great range of hostel based yoga trips on this wonderful concept, but if you would like more luxury hiking/yoga trips also run by a professional yoga instructor, we can highly recommend the excellent Yoga Trails\n\n**Why Outdooraholics?**\nA very good question. There are some superb London based walking groups on Meetup - Backabush are well known for over a decade of organising superb hiking weekends and brought the whole concept of great value hiking trips to Meetup and Trailblazer have been organising an excellent and huge range of days hikes for over 5 years now. Both groups we highly recommend and regularly hear great things about their trips and both have inspired many other groups to offer similar events to theirs. 1000 Foot Hiking club is also highly recommended - run by some inspirational people on a non profit basis with all money raised going to a water aid charity.\nExcept for Outdooraholics most of the major London hiking groups on Meetup have evolved out of Backabush and Trailblazer and generally run the same format as their trips. Whilst we'd be lying if we said we weren't inspired by the great trips these groups run, we wanted to do something different and new and created Outdooraholics from scratch and we believe giving our trips a quite different flavour. We get you out of London on aaa rated trips. We took a very simple idea as our basis - of organising all of the logistics for our hiking trips so that you don't have to. We advise you what to bring, you turn up and you'll have a great time. All of our trips are run by trip leaders from that particular country so we believe they can show you the country and culture like only a local can. We organise an equal mix of day hikes and weekend trips and put the same detailed planning into both.\nWe also try to use local tour guides for the majority of our trips so that you can get a proper insight in to the history, culture and country that you're visiting - after all you wouldn't expect to visit Russia for example and be \"shown\" the country and it's cultures by a British person!\nWe plan all of our trips in advance including the routes that we take to ensure that we show you the best of an area and also that we know what the risks are on the tracks and indeed that the trails are passable and safe. All of the photos on our trips are taken by one of our hike leaders, from that trip, on the paths that you will actually be hiking so that you can best decide which trips appeal to you. The great outdoors does carry risks which is why we pre walk and plan all of our routes and trips.\nWe believe we offer the most diverse range of both day hikes and weekend trips available in the UK.\nWe only offer superb trips and we even have a professional chef who joins us on many of our weekend trips to offer great food, which is much appreciated after a tough days hiking.\n\n**Safety**\nOur main hike leader has undertaken both a four day [Walk Group Leader](http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/walking-group-leader-award) course accredited by the MLT (Mountain Leader Training) and a six day [Mountain Leader](http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/mountain-leader-award) course (also accredited by the MLT) as well as having a two day outdoor Activity First Aid course and over 20 years of extensive and diverse hiking and leading experience. All of our trips are run by very experienced hikers with Outdoor Activity First Aid qualifications and most of our trip leaders are a minimum of Mountain Leader trained with 2 of our trip leaders having a military background. Sadly the outdoors always presents risks but through our experience, training and careful planning as well as pre planning and walking all of our routes we do our best to minimise those.\n\n**Further information**\nYou can email us at: info@outdooraholics.co.uk\nOr you can follow us and our hiking adventures on Facebook:\n[http://www.facebook.com/outdooraholics](http://www.facebook.com/outdooraholics)\nWe sincerely look forward to meeting you at one of our weekend or hiking day trip adventures soon and can ensure a warm welcome from the Outdooraholics team to you\n\n**Joining the Team**\nWe are looking for experienced hike leaders (ideally with at least Mountain Leader level training) and whilst we demand a lot from people, working with the largest hiking group in London and one of the largest in Europe brings a lot of advantages too. Safety and enjoyment of people attending our trips is paramount. You don't have to be based in the South East or London as we have a demand for people in all locations. If you share these values, please email us for more details along with a summary of your experience: info@outdooraholics.co.uk",

        "description": "**If you are going through a divorce, thinking about a divorce, are newly separated, or already divorced, then this group is for you.**\n\n**Divorce can be challenging, but it is also a real opportunity for personal growth and change. Lucy and Isabelle co-founded Divorce Club back in 2016 for one simple reason – we know that no one should go through divorce alone! It's now the largest Divorce Club in the UK.**\n\nYou may be feeling lonely, unsupported or simply looking for friendly help & advice in order to move on. Afterall, what other life event can uproot you from your home, shake your financial security, reduce your time with your children and make friends and family disappear overnight? Sometimes you don’t know where to turn, or just feel angry or sad.\n\nThat’s where we at Divorce Club London can help.\n\nWe know it can be really tough going through a divorce. It’s hard to find people who know how you feel unless they’ve been through it. Divorce Club London is hosted by people who have been through a divorce and who know exactly what you’re going through (whatsmore our co-founder Isabelle is a clinical psychologist). So we know that the best remedy for the pain of divorce is to meet others in the same boat and make a fresh start. We also know that trying to navigate the legal and financial side is an additional pressure, just when you’re at your lowest ebb.\n\nDivorce Club London connects people to every single resource they may need to get through a divorce from the moment of separation to moving on and meeting someone new. We aim to reduce the sense of isolation and overwhelm in the first stage of separation but also look to help people identify how to look forward and rebuild their lives. We fundamentally believe out of the ashes of the end of a relationship, new beginnings and a huge opportunity for growth arise.\n\nFor newly separated people we offer advice and help on the process and emotional overwhelm. As people go through the process they have continuous access to legal and financial advice while also being able to tap into a community of people who can share the roller coaster of milestones, difficulties and triumphs. And for those in the later stages we offer coaching for goal setting, and online sessions for moving on, dating and growth.\n\nDivorce Club London provides expert information that takes the mystery and fear out of divorce. We have guest speakers from top law firms, mediators, psychologists, parenting experts, divorce coaches, financial advisors, dating experts and many more - advice that usually costs a lot of money!\n\nFor less than the price of a weekly takeout coffee, you can join us and meet other people who know exactly what you’re going through.\n\nMembership includes access to:\n\n* Weekly social zoom calls\n* Legal Q&As with respected family lawyers\n* Financial Q&As\n* Parenting sessions\n* Goal setting\n* Book clubs\n* Divorce orientated workshops\n* Access to a 24/7 community messaging channel\n* In real life meetups and socials\n\nFor just £7.99 a month, you can get inclusive access to all of our events, access to chat in our private community, and a service which aims to match you with friends. We even give you the first month for free.\nWhatsmore, we host a free Meetup group session once a month so you can come and see what Divorce Club is all about.\n\nSo we hope that you invest in giving yourself a better divorce, and a better recovery. We passionately believe that you can have an amazing life after divorce! There is such an opportunity for growth and many of our members have said how much happier they are two, three, four years down the line – so hang on in there. Start again, with us.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you!\nLucy Davis & Dr Isabelle Hung\n\n**[SIGN UP TO BE A MEMBER – FIRST MONTH FREE!](https://www.divorceclub.com/membership/)**\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n**Join Divorce Club**\n**Find out more at [Divorce Club](https://www.divorceclub.com/), and see our [membership options](https://www.divorceclub.com/membership/)**",

It is difficult when all of your friends are in couples and your attached friends cannot come out with you at the weekend to a singles event if they don't wish to cause problems in their relationships. Coming out alone is not easy so we put ladies in touch with each other so they can have a chat before coming to an event together.\nI should add that this is what we do for our events with Contact Singles.

        "description": "ABOUT:\nAre you a young professional in London looking to meet other LGBT young professionals? Then we hope to see you at the coming drinks! They are organised every other Tuesday in the Yard bar, top floor, from 7pm onwards. We don't do guest lists, so even if you didn't sign up through Meetup you are more than welcome.\nMany have noticed that it can be difficult to meet up with the LGBT community once you leave university. For this reason we've decided to start organising drinks for young professionals, intended for those who love to have a drink with like-minded people after a busy day of work. Do spread the word, and bring friends, colleagues and family!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ:\n\n\n\n\n❓It's my first time and I'm coming alone, should I be nervous?\nNo, you found the right event! Almost everyone joins these drinks alone and there are always a bunch of first timers. Just grab a drink and say hi to those around the reserved tables and you'll be absolutely fine :)\n\n\n\n\n❓I cannot make it at 7pm, can I come later?\nYes, definitely! There will always be one of the organisers present from 7pm onwards, but most people just join whenever they can. There is no official 'start' so to say, and it usually stays busy till around 10pm-11pm. For first timers it can be easier to mingle if you come before 8pm, when it's not that busy yet.\n\n\n\n\n❓How often are the drinks and where are they held?\nWe have drinks every two weeks from 7pm in the Yard bar in Soho. Sometimes we organise other events such as pub crawls and picnics. Just keep an eye on the Meetup page.\n\n\n\n\n❓Is there a dress code?\nNope, not at all. Just wear whatever you want.\n\n\n\n\n❓Is there a cost?\nOnly for whatever drinks you buy at the bar.\n\n\n\n\n❓What's the age profile?\nMost people who attend range from their early twenties to their early thirties.\n\n\n\n\n❓Are the Tuesday drinks for networking?\nNo, the drinks are super casual, and and not intended to find your new dream job. We have people from all different professional backgrounds, so it's always cool to hear what others are up to.\n\n\n\n\n❓I don't drink alcohol, can I come?\nOf course! Since it's on a Tuesday many take it easy, so you won't be an outlier.\n\n\n\n\nA note on behaviour:\nThis Meetup attracts a diverse group of people of all different backgrounds, personalities, and opinions. We aim to provide a safe space for people of all backgrounds, gender identities, and ethnicities. Whilst similarities and differences in both opinions and personalities are inevitable, we will not tolerate racism, bullying, and/or discrimination. ",

        "description": "Welcome to **Shy Bis & Gay Guys**!\n(formerly \"Shy Gay and Bi Men\")\nA group for Gay, bi men who would like to meet others that do not always find it easy socialising and meeting new people.\n\n===\nINTRODUCTION\n\nShyness and social anxiety can hold guys back from forming meaningful platonic and romantic relationships. It can be tough enough ‘coming out’, but being introverted can make it even more of a challenge and sometimes you need a gentle push.\n\nSo, whether you consider yourself to be ‘gay’, ‘bi’, ‘bi-curious’, ‘pansexual’ or any other label; whether you are ‘in the closet’, ‘out’ or in the process of ‘coming out’; whether you are vulnerable or feel at risk, this group brings us together. We embrace those who have experienced depression, anxiety, loneliness or isolation, especially if you may be considered on the spectrums of ADHD, Autism & Asperger’s, Bipolar, OCD and/or Schizophrenia.\n\nYou may be a highly sensitive person who experiences intense highs and lows to an extreme degree. You may be an artistic Creative with a vivid inner world hidden and locked away. You may feel easily overwhelmed by large groups of people, unsettled by the turbulence of the LGBTQ+ dating scene or sidelined/neglected in a whirlwind of rapidly spinning social circles. Anxiety may have even prevented you from moving forwards in friendships and relationships with other people because you are afraid of either hurting or getting hurt. This Meetup group is designed for you!\n\nHave you ever taken years to build up the confidence to attend an event only to be disappointed? Want to attend an LGBTQ+ event but held back by your shyness? Simply come as you are. There is no need to pretend anymore. This is a get together for people who do not want to be alone, to feel comfortable, and foster a nice, friendly circle of people. And if you would like to attend but do not feel like talking much, then that is cool, too! Take it at your own pace.\n\n===\nDETAILS\n\nThis free group is for friendship and dating, designed to reach out to others and create mutual support. The concept is simple: helping one another get out there in the world. Some meet-ups are limited to 6 or 12 places so that it is not too overwhelming for new members. I will provide my contact details 24 hours before each event either in a group e-mail or in a private message. Do feel free to get in touch if you would like to have a chat about the event before you attend!\n\nI do not charge fees for attending our meet-ups. All I ask is that a one-off discretionary donation is made for your first time. This is to help cover the cost of running the group. Meetup groups are not free to run and cost £180 over the course of a year. I have put a link below (Paypal) where you give a one-off donation of £10 (or any amount) to help out. The group will always remain free so there is no obligation but it would be greatly appreciated. The link works on both desktops and smartphones.\n\n[paypal.me/roryduffy27 ](paypal.me/roryduffy27 )\n\nFacebook:\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/shybisandgayguys](https://www.facebook.com/groups/shybisandgayguys)",

Showing up is a commitment we want everyone to make, as this helps the organisers maximise the spaces booked, helps the attendees meet more new people, and most importantly it help you fulfil the commitment you made to yourself to meet nice new friends.</p><p><br /></p><p>WE STRICTLY DO NOT DO ANY NETWORING OR ANY BUSINESS-RELATED EVENTS OF ANY KIND, NO EXCEPTIONS. This group is for meaningful friendships and quality time amongst women in London.</p><p><br /></p><p>NO-SHOW POLICY – We would like to maximise every event for your full enjoyment, therefore we encourage you to turn up to the events you RSVP to. All attendance is monitored. TWO missed events will be marked as 'no-shows', and a polite reminder will be sent to you. If you do not show up THREE times when you have RSVP'd as \"Yes\" without sending a message and changing your RSVP, you will be automatically removed from the group. Its important you RSVP to things you can attend to, and change you RSVP in good time if other plans come up. Please do this so we can offer your spot to someone else if you decide not to attend. This rule applies to last minute drop outs (UNDER 48hrs) without a message too. This is to make sure that we maximise all the space we book for events and include more people who want to participate and enjoy meeting each other.</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>PAYMENT - Please note, running this group is not free and lead organisers pay Meet-up a monthly fee to keep the group running. Therefore RSVPs will be charged a non-refundable £3 for all events. Some events might also require an additional fee if the restaurant or event venue requires a prepayment. This £3 is non-refundable under all circumstances unless only if the organisers cancel the event. If you cancel your RSVP the non-refund still applies. If you would like to support the continued running of this group you can also donate any amount to our PayPal pool which I can send to you if you request the link :)</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>WAITLIST - Please be aware that we currently don't have waitlist and all events are first come first serve. Updates will be sent out once we can have a functioning waitlist.</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>SAFETY AND COURTESY: We want everyone to have a fun and safe time when attending our events, and we want our organisers to communicate with attendees about event  updates with confidence that they will be treated with respect - therefore we follow Meet-up's policy on safety strictly.  We do not tolerate any abusive language towards anyone in this group. Please DM people with respect. Any members found to be harassing/insulting/threatening/bullying any member of this group will be removed immediately and the ban will be permanent. We also make reports to meet-up who have the power to remove any policy breakers of the platform completely.</p><p><br /></p><p>SOCIAL MEDIA: Our Instagram handle is @femalefriendsLDN. Please follow. We take pictures at events. If you do not want your picture uploaded please let the organiser know and they will delete all pictures featuring you.</p>",

        "description": "Ever wanted to try bouldering/indoor wall climbing? It is an exciting and fun way to stay fit: it is challenging, both physically and mentally, and a great way to exercise! I remember walking pass the Arch at Bermondsey and wondering “where on earth are those people walking to, especially with those funny shoes hanging from their backpacks” before I knew it I was one of those people! lol\n\nI plan to have weekly bouldering Meet-ups for people who are curious about bouldering or like bouldering and want to have some good company and vibes while at it. We can cheer each other on and work on problems together!\n\nAll levels are welcome! Even if you are a complete beginner, though kindly please watch the safety intro video ([The Arch Climbing Wall - Safety Intro ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBTStDqP_9c)) and fill out the [register online form here ](https://signups.archclimbingwall.com/)\\- please make sure to watch the video all the way through as there is important info in it that you’ll be asked a few questions about on your very first visit to the Arch centre\\. Nevertheless\\, you will have your fellow Bermondsey Boulders to support you on your very first climb and future climbs :\\-\\)\n\nI am sure the intermediate and advance climbers will be happy to share some tips when you attend, I know I will need it lol. Let’s get to know each other and help each other out to make this group a positive and fulfilling experience for everyone.\n\nTwice a week, from 6:30pm on Wednesday and 11:00am on Sundays we will be meeting at the Surrey Quays Arch & Bermondsey Arch. Let us enjoy bouldering together. The entrance is within the biscuit factory compound that also has the PureGym Bermondsey branch. For the Surrey Quays centre, you can't miss it just go to the Shopping centre entrance and it will be on your left.\n\nAll you need to bring are a comfortable change of clothes that are easy to move in. The Arch provides lockers to keep your personal belongings safe as well.\n\nThe Surrey Quays branch is now completed this new Rotherhithe SE16 branch is located in the heart of the biggest Shopping Complex in the Borough, so cool right? And do not worry, it is literally the same distance you will travel from Bermondsey Station to Arch one. \n\nAfter the Sunday session, let us have lunch together at the famous Bermondsey Maltby Street Market..it is a 15 minute walk from the Arch.…. They have a good variety of cooked food to buy.. yum!\n\nThis event is completely free to attend, and the only costs you have to bear are the Arch fees and/or shoe rental.\n\nIndoor bouldering is safe (if you follow the guidelines) and offers a great workout, no matter what your age! So if you have ever been curious about the sport of bouldering, or wanting to get back into it with some company this group is a great place to start in what I hope will be a safe and friendly atmosphere for you. Check out some of our session's highlights here - https://www.meetup.com/bermondsey-boulders/photos/\n\nThe bouldering sessions will be taking place in the Arch centres (bouldering only) in SE16. These are located in the neighbouring districts of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe (Southwark is so bless)\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me! Let’s enjoy bouldering together and make new friends along the way !\n\n[Event Summary]\n\nLocations: Arch Climbing Wall: Building One, Bermondsey SE16 (10min from Bermondsey Station)\n                  Arch Climbing Wall, Surrey Quays, Rotherhithe SE16 (10min from Canada Water Station & Surrey Quays Overground Station)\n\nDate & Time: Twice a week,\n6:30pm - 9:30pm (Can join and leave anytime, Wednesdays)\n                                             11:00am - 13:00pm (Lunch afterwards at Maltby Street Market, Sundays)\n\nLevel: Beginners are welcome!

The aim of our group is to provide our members with opportunities to meet new people in the area with similar interests and to make new friends who want to get out and about in the local area. We will be offering a range of events and have a strong commitment to supporting our local community and local events. We will be aiming to offer a range of events, such as film nights, theatre trips, concerts, book club, the wine club, quizzes, pub nights, meals out etc. We will also be hoping to offer outdoor events such as walks and hikes and other physical activities in the beautiful Chilterns area around us. <br>Initially, due to lockdown, we will resume some of our regular events such as the book club (via Zoom) and walks (with limited numbers). <br>You will recognise our event hosts as the same people who made great efforts to provide members with a variety of events over several years in the former Berkhamsted Social group which has now come to an end. We will be looking for new, committed hosts with fresh ideas, too, to help our local group grow and develop, offering a range of regular and new events to suit the different interests and tastes of our members. Some events will have a small cost so that the organisers can cover the subscription fees, but many events will remain free of charge. We ask that all members keep their RSVP’s up to date and respect the efforts made by all hosts in offering local and varied events for our enjoyment. <br>Look forward to you joining us at an event soon! </p>",
