        "description": "Hi all,\n\nHope everyone's well!\n\nSo I've confirmed the details for the first meet up next week and really looking forward to it.\n\nLocation - We'll be heading to The Old Cross in North Street, Chichester (transport info to be added as a separate comment).\n\nPlease do update your 'attending' status if you can't make it!\n\nAs this is the first time we're meeting up, I thought it might be nice to keep it informal and go the pub. I have a pretty good idea of how to structure the meet ups moving forward in terms of quiet writing time followed by the chance to stay and socialise, but for this first one I figured it would be nice to familiarise ourselves and get an idea of what people would like from a Chichester Writers' group.\n\nI was part of a similar group in Brighton and I know how beneficial it can be to have a specific place/ community to focus on your writing - so looking to replicate it here and meet some likeminded people!\n\nThey'll be a sign on the table - I have optimistically booked a table for 12 so all being well we should stick out a little.\n\nI have noted whose currently attending and the website will automatically cap people from attending in the unlikely event we hit more than 12 - so please do check before bringing a friend etc.\n\nFinally, if anyone is set on writing during the first session then please do bring your equipment, and we can have a writing end of the table, but I think as mentioned this first session is probably more of an icebreaker!\n\nHope to see you there,\n\nDavid",

        "description": "One of the key aspects of fiction writing is developing and using an adept style of writing. There are many elements that go towards this, but for this meet-up we will concentrate on three of these.\n\nThis session will delve into elements that go towards writing and we will concentrate on the fabric (so to speak) of writing style.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This will be an interactive session sitting around a table. So you will discuss and engage with other members of the meeting.\n\nAGENDA:\n\n1. Show, don't tell (Detail/Specifics).\n2. Evocation (Evoking emotions).\n3. Profluence (Profluence).\n\n1. SHOW, DON' TELL:\n\nOne of the most commonly discussed aspects of writing style. - We will discuss this and then try some examples. Starting with some basic 'tell' sentences and then developing them to see how they can be improved.\n\nIn this session there will be around four or more sentences that will be given to the group for jumping off points. Some time will be allowed for the group to chat and come up with suggestions for how the sentence(s) can be developed.\n\nE.G.\n\n- 'John walks down the street to his grandmother's house.'\n\nNothing wrong with the above sentence, but it is not engaging with the reader.\n\nInstead, try writing:\n\n- 'Every step was like walking through mud, as sweat rolled down his cheeks and an impending feeling of doom saturated John’s mind, for he knew that soon he will be at his grandmother’s house.'\n\n2. EVOCATION:\n\nEvoking emotions. This is a sure fire way to engage with your audience. There are many ways to do this and (perhaps worryingly at times) newspapers or websites often do this with great effect even though they are not writing fiction.\n\nCreating an impulsive or engaging feeling that draws in the reader. This can be subtle or have a great effect.\n\nWe will discuss examples and ways of how to do this. Ways to do this could be show injustice, love, vengeance... etc..\n\nWe will also write some example paragraphs that evoke emotions.\n\n3. PROFLUENCE:\n\nMoving your story forward and keeping the reader engaged.\n\nThere are numerous ways to do this and some of these will be discussed.\n\nFor example plot points, creating anticipation, revealing a mystery, etc... Are all ways and methods to keep your reader interested.\n\n-------------\n\nOther Details:\n\n1. Although not 100% necessary - it would be a very good idea to bring along a notepad and pen/pencil.\n\n2. This will be a short session of 1 hour and 30 mins.\n\n3. Please remember to bring a photo ID and scan it at the guest registration tablets at the front desk when you. If your photo ID does not successfully scan, please check in at the tablet as a guest of \"Meetup Event\".\n\n4. Any questions please ask.\n\n5. As the topic of writing style is huge it will concentrate on three aspects and will cover as much as possible in the short time available in this session.\n\n6.

        "description": "In the workshop, we will discuss ideas, structure and plot points that relate to classic victorian ghost stories and in particular those of M.R.James.\n\nThe aim will be for you to learn how to write in a Jamesian style and then in your own time proceed to write a short ghost story.\n\nIf you already have a lot of experience in this genre, please still feel to join and share your knowledge.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAgenda:\n\nThe meetup will be a laid back workshop and participants will be encouraged to engage in the discussion.\n\n1. A short introduction to the Jamesian style.\n\n2. An overview of general approaches to making your writing suspenseful:\n2.1 Limit the POV.\n2.2 Style and form.\n2.3 Dramatic irony.\n\nThen the body of the meetup will be for all to discuss and come up with ideas following the points below - for your own ghost stories.\n\n- We will stop halfway through for a short break of around 10 mins.\n\n3. The Jamesian Style:\n3.1 Location and setting.\n3.2 The main protagonist.\n3.3 An object.\n\nI will bring some specific examples of characters and settings from some of James stories.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTo create the perfect Jamesian ghost story you will need the ingredients below:\n\n1. A quaint, ancient setting. Such as a twee English country village, an estranged seaside town or a stately Abbey. James loved to utilise the antiquity of a colourful setting with an isolated atmosphere.\n\n2. A lady or gentleman protagonist. Many of James’ characters are naive reserved scholars, who are often not convinced something strange is happening until the final climax of the story.\n\n3. A pivotal antiquarian object. Whether an old book or an antique, the discovery of a mystery object that unlocks and attracts an unwelcome figure from beyond the grave is a signature mark of James’ stories.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe story that you produce will be after the meetup, will be at your own pace and in your own time, but it would be great to see your short stories, if you wish to share them, once they have been completed.\n\n-------------------------\n\nJames was a lecturer at Cambridge University and at Christmas time he became well known for reading back his ghost stories.\n\nHe was master of the uncanny, the purveyor of the uncomfortable and a writer renowned for his atmospheric ghostly tales. It was also in Victorian times a tradition to tell ghost stories and one of the most famous ghost stories of all time was set in the Christmas period - that, of course, being \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens.\n\nJameson ghost storytelling was straight down the line and revolved around the idea of real ghosts, not psychological illusions or paranoid affects of the human mind. So if you prefer writing psychological type ghost or horror stories then this workshop may not be for you.\n\n- Just to note - although Jame's stories were published in the Edwardian period, he wrote and shared them primarily during at the end of the Victorian period.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThe writer M.R. James once said: “Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo.… Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.”\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe owner of Frequency Cafe has kindly let us use this space for free. Although you don't have to, please do consider buying a coffee or something to eat if you can.",

        "description": "One of the key aspects of fiction writing is developing and using an adept style of writing. There are many elements that go towards this, but for this meet-up, we will concentrate on:- 'Show, Don't Tell' and 'Evocation.'\n\nThis session will delve into these key elements that go towards an effective writing style.\n\n-----------------\n\nNOTE: This will be an interactive session sitting around a table. So you will discuss and engage with other members of the meeting.\n\nThis session suits both new or experienced writers who are looking for a refresh or discussion on these topics.\n\n------------------\n\nAGENDA: (7 pm to 8.30 pm).\n\n1. Show, Don't Tell (Detail/Specifics).\n2. Evocation (Evoking emotions).\n3. Cultivation of a Paragraph (bringing your own example).\n\n1. SHOW, DON' TELL:\n\nOne of the most commonly discussed aspects of writing style. We will discuss this and then try some examples. Starting with some basic 'tell' sentences and then developing them to see how they can be improved.\n\nIn this session, there will be around four or more sentences that will be given to the group for jumping off points. Some time will be allowed for the group to chat and come up with suggestions for how the sentence(s) can be developed.\n\nE.G.\n\n- 'John walks down the street to his grandmother's house.'\n\nNothing wrong with the above sentence, but it may not be engaging with the reader.\n\nInstead, try writing:\n\n- 'Every step was like walking through mud, as sweat rolled down his cheeks and an impending feeling of doom saturated John’s mind, for he knew that soon he will be at his grandmother’s house.'\n\n2. EVOCATION:\n\nEvoking emotions. This is a sure fire way to engage with your audience. There are many ways to do this and (perhaps worryingly at times) newspapers or websites often do this with great effect even though they are not writing fiction.\n\nCreating an impulsive or engaging feeling that draws in the reader. This can be subtle or have a great effect.\n\nWe will discuss examples and ways of how to do this. Ways to do this could be show injustice, love, vengeance... etc..\n\nWe will also create a paragraph and use that to evoke emotions.\n\n3. YOUR PARAGRAPH:\n\nAs part of this meet-up please prepare a paragraph on any subject you wish. (I will bring along one to discuss as well).\n\nThen bring this to the meet-up and at the end of the workshop as a group we will look at this paragraph and discuss how (if possible) it can be built upon.\n\nYou don't need to print this out and can just read it out from your phone or laptop.\n\n-----------------\n\nOther Details:\n\n1. This meetup will be held online and I will share the link nearer to the workshop time.\n\n2. The meetup will be held using a video service called Whereby.\n\n3. I will share handouts via google docs at the start of the meeting - but I will need an email address to share these.",

It will be – www.mysite.wordpress.com instead of www.mysite.com.\n\n---------------------\n\nIt goes without saying that in the modern-day world a huge amount of communication and information is provided from the internet and accessed through mobile devices and desktop PCs.\n\nBy staking a space for yourself online you are creating a central point for where you can share and display your work. And also where you can promote your work and potentially build a community.\n\nThis will be a short 2-hour course and by the end of it, you will have a WordPress.com website and will have the basic knowledge to be able to go on and build similar Wordpress.com sites.\n\n------------------\nAgenda:\n\n1. Introduction:\n1.1 The difference between WordPress.com and Wordpress.org\n1.2 Creating a clear vision for your website.\n1.3 Listing the key requirements and prioritising.\n\n2. Sourcing design assets and images.\n\n3. Stage 1:\n3.1 Setting up the site.\n3.2 Choosing a template to start with.\n\n4. Stage 2:\n4.1 Initial configuration.\n4.2 Adding pages.\n4.3 Adding posts.\n4.4 Adding a Menu and Customisation.\n\n5. An Agile approach: Don’t aim to be perfect! Some of the best feedback you’ll get is when the site is live.\n\n------------------\n\nAny questions please ask.\n\n(The course will be held by Chris Mitchell who has worked in technology and project management roles for over 10 years and who has built numerous websites, both large and small.)",

You don't need to have anything you're already working on (though if you do, also cool), and you don't have to share your work with the group if you don't want to. Writers of all levels of experience are welcome (and If you've attended before, note that there will be no repeat exercises: all fresh material here!)\n\nThroughout the session, the activities will build on each other so that when you leave you should have plenty of material to work with on your own if you wish. You will also have lots of new tricks and strategies that you can use in the future if you get creatively stuck or are searching for new ideas. This workshop is perfect for anyone who is looking to start a new project, is battling writer's block, or simply wants to explore their creative side (beginners are more than welcome!).\n\nCome with a notebook, pen, computer (bearing in mind that we will be outdoors), whatever you prefer to write with -- and a willingness to play and explore!\n\nArrive at 2pm for a 2:15ish start. We will be meeting by the gazebo in Walpole Park (which is near the cafe and near-ish the pond). Bring something to sit on if you wish (i.e. pillow or blanket as we will be on the ground). We will have hand sanitiser, but bring your own if you can!\n\nThere are no refunds available for this event, but if something happens on the day please get in touch, we may be able to give you a place on a different workshop at a later date.\n\nAgain, we will be VERY STRICT ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING at this event. Masks are optional as we will be outdoors, but please maintain the recommended distance as much as possible.\n\nSee you then!!",

        "description": "One of the key aspects of fiction writing is developing and using an adept and clear style of writing. There are many elements that go towards this, but for this meet-up, we will concentrate on:- 'Show, Don't Tell' and 'Evocation.'\n\nThis session will delve into these key elements that go towards an effective writing style.\n\n-----------------\n\nNOTE: This will be an interactive session online, so you will discuss and engage with other members of the meeting.\n\nThis session is suited more towards new writers, but is also open to those who are more experienced and looking for a refresh, or a discussion on these topics.\n\n------------------\n\nAGENDA:\n\n1. Show, Don't Tell (Detail/Specifics).\n2. Evocation (Evoking emotions).\n3. Cultivation of a Paragraph (bringing your own example).\n\n1. SHOW, DON' TELL:\n\nOne of the most commonly discussed aspects of writing style. We will discuss this and then try some examples. Starting with some basic 'tell' sentences and then developing them to see how they can be improved.\n\nIn this session, there will be around four or more sentences that will be given to the group for jumping-off points. Some time will be allowed for the group to chat and come up with suggestions for how the sentence(s) can be developed.\n\nE.G.\n\n- 'John walks down the street to his grandmother's house.'\n\nNothing wrong with the above sentence, but it may not be engaging with the reader.\n\nInstead, try writing:\n\n- 'Every step was like walking through mud, as sweat rolled down his cheeks and an impending feeling of doom saturated John’s mind, for he knew that soon he will be at his grandmother’s house.'\n\n2. EVOCATION:\n\nEvoking emotions. This is a sure-fire way to engage with your audience. There are many ways to do this and (perhaps worryingly at times) newspapers or websites often do this with great effect even though they are not writing fiction.\n\nCreating an impulsive or engaging feeling that draws in the reader. This can be subtle or have a great effect.\n\nWe will discuss examples and ways of how to do this. Ways to do this could be show injustice, love, vengeance... etc..\n\nWe will also create a paragraph and use that to evoke emotions.\n\n3. YOUR PARAGRAPH:\n\nAs part of this meet-up please prepare a paragraph on any subject you wish. (I will bring along one to discuss as well).\n\nThen bring this to the meet-up and at the end of the workshop as a group we will look at this paragraph and discuss how (if possible) it can be built upon.\n\n-----------------\n\nOther Details:\n\n1. This meetup will be held online and I will share the link nearer to the workshop time directly with those that sign up. I will most likely be using https://jitsi.org/ or Google Meet.\n\nFYI - Jitsi is a super easy to use video conference tool and does not require an account to use.\n\n2. I will share handouts via google docs at the start of the meeting - but I will need an email address to share these.\n\n3. There are no refunds available for this event, but if you can't make it on the day please get in touch, we may well be able to give you a place on a different workshop at a later date.",

There are many elements that go towards this, but for this meet-up, we will concentrate on:- 'Show, Don't Tell' and 'Evocation.'\n\nThis session will delve into these key elements that go towards an effective writing style.\n\n-----------------\n\nNOTE: This will be an interactive session online, so you will discuss and engage with other members of the meeting.\n\nThis session is suited more towards new writers, but is also open to those who are more experienced and looking for a refresh, or a discussion on these topics.\n\n------------------\n\nAGENDA:\n\n1. Show, Don't Tell (Detail/Specifics).\n2. Evocation (Evoking emotions).\n3. Cultivation of a Paragraph (bringing your own example).\n\n1. SHOW, DON' TELL:\n\nOne of the most commonly discussed aspects of writing style. We will discuss this and then try some examples. Starting with some basic 'tell' sentences and then developing them to see how they can be improved.\n\nIn this session, there will be around four or more sentences that will be given to the group for jumping-off points. Some time will be allowed for the group to chat and come up with suggestions for how the sentence(s) can be developed.\n\nE.G.\n\n- 'John walks down the street to his grandmother's house.'\n\nNothing wrong with the above sentence, but it may not be engaging with the reader.\n\nInstead, try writing:\n\n- 'Every step was like walking through mud, as sweat rolled down his cheeks and an impending feeling of doom saturated John’s mind, for he knew that soon he will be at his grandmother’s house.'\n\n2. EVOCATION:\n\nEvoking emotions. This is a sure-fire way to engage with your audience. There are many ways to do this and (perhaps worryingly at times) newspapers or websites often do this with great effect even though they are not writing fiction.\n\nCreating an impulsive or engaging feeling that draws in the reader. This can be subtle or have a great effect.\n\nWe will discuss examples and ways of how to do this. Ways to do this could be show injustice, love, vengeance... etc..\n\nWe will also create a paragraph and use that to evoke emotions.\n\n3. YOUR PARAGRAPH:\n\nAs part of this meet-up please prepare a paragraph on any subject you wish. (I will bring along one to discuss as well).\n\nThen bring this to the meet-up and at the end of the workshop as a group we will look at this paragraph and discuss how (if possible) it can be built upon.\n\n-----------------\n\nOther Details:\n\n1. This meetup will be held online and I will share the link nearer to the workshop time directly with those that sign up. I will be using https://jitsi.org/\n\nFYI - Jitsi is a super easy to use video conference tool and does not require an account to use.\n\n2. I will share handouts via google docs at the start of the meeting - but I will need an email address to share these, or I will just message them directly over meetup.\n\n3. There are no refunds available for this event, but if you can't make it on the day please get in touch, we may be able to give you a place on a different workshop at a later date.",

The Jamesian Style:\n3.1 Location and setting.\n3.2 The main protagonist.\n3.3 An object.\n\nI will bring some specific examples of characters and settings from some of James stories.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTo create the perfect Jamesian ghost story you will need the ingredients below:\n\n1. A quaint, ancient setting. Such as a twee English country village, an estranged seaside town or a stately Abbey. James loved to utilise the antiquity of a colourful setting with an isolated atmosphere.\n\n2. A lady or gentleman protagonist. Many of James’ characters are naive reserved scholars, who are often not convinced something strange is happening until the final climax of the story.\n\n3. A pivotal antiquarian object. Whether an old book or an antique, the discovery of a mystery object that unlocks and attracts an unwelcome figure from beyond the grave is a signature mark of James’ stories.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe story that you produce will be after the meetup, will be at your own pace and in your own time, but it would be great to see your short stories if you wish to share them.\n\n-------------------------\n\nJames was a lecturer at Cambridge University and at Christmas time he became well known for reading back his ghost stories.\n\nHe was master of the uncanny, the purveyor of the uncomfortable and a writer renowned for his atmospheric ghostly tales. It was also in Victorian times a tradition to tell ghost stories and one of the most famous ghost stories of all time was set in the Christmas period - that, of course, being \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens.\n\nJameson ghost storytelling was straight down the line and revolved around the idea of real ghosts, not psychological illusions or paranoid affects of the human mind. So if you prefer writing psychological type ghost or horror stories then this workshop may not be for you.\n\n- Just to note - although Jame's stories were published in the Edwardian period, he wrote and shared them primarily during at the end of the Victorian period.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThe writer M.R. James once said: “Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo.… Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.”\n\n-------------------------\n\n1.

We will then guide you through the experience of building your story's emotional arc, and you will leave the workshop with a toolbox of tips, tricks, and exercises that you will be able to use again whenever you need.\n\nThis workshop is perfect for writers of all levels of experience, and it may be especially useful for those of you who are taking on NaNoWriMo!

        "description": "This is the first in a series of DEEP DIVE creative writing workshops that will get you up close and personal with different fundamental aspects of the writing process. These workshops will help you to hone your creative wordsmithing skills as well as increase your understanding of what makes good writing and how to achieve it.\n\nIn this deep dive workshop, we will look at THREE-ACT STRUCTURE -- in other words, what a story needs in its beginning, middle, and end. We will go deep into the conventions here and also look at some examples of successful three-act structure in storytelling. We will demystify these rules of thumb as well as empower you to know when to break them, drawing from examples of writing that subverts, flaunts, or otherwise ignores the typical structure.\n\nIn addition to the information and examples provided, you can expect a number of practical prompts and exercises that will help you to become better acquainted with three-act structure so that you will be able to skillfully apply these techniques to your own projects. This highly informative and fun workshop will leave you with the understanding and the confidence to structure your own writing in a way that makes your story compelling, organic, and satisfying to an audience.\n\nThis workshop is perfect for writers of all levels of experience. Come ready with a notebook, pen, computer, whatever you prefer to write with -- and a willingness to play and explore! Bring a work-in-progress you'd like to develop, or use this workshop to discover and build an entirely new project.\n\nEnter the online meeting room from 2pm for a 2:10ish start. The meetup will be conducted on Zoom. Any questions about Zoom, just ask!\n\nThere are no refunds available for this event, but if something happens on the day please get in touch, we may be able to give you a place on a different workshop at a later date.\n\nSee you then!!",

Tickets are £15 and will be bought/booked all together. I'm not including 3D glasses in case people already have them.\n\nNOTE: TICKETS WILL BE PURCHASED ON THURSDAY NIGHT! If people register after that, I'll do my best to book them in as close to where the first group is sitting. So, ASAP as soon as you can!\n\nThe Cineworld in West India Quay is top shelf, big comfy seats. We'll head over to the pub afterwards for some food and pints as well. Only a few minutes walk from the DLR (West India or Westferry are the closest).\n\nShould be a blast ... looks like this might be a real winner!",

Stories will be critiqued in round-robin speed-date format, so that every submitted story will receive at least a few critiques. Critiques will be assigned to attendees a week before the meeting (2-3), so please sign up early.\n\nAlso, we'll be charging a small amount for this meeting to go towards the venue and the prize winners!

I'll be booking for the 2D theatre, in the premium section (which are much more comfortable and well-positioned seats).

        "description": "This will be the first meetup for our new Novel track. The meeting will revolve around discussing a suitable format going forward, looking at things like:\n\n- meeting frequency\n\n- critique format\n\n- meeting format\n\n- establishing reading/writing genres so that we can pair like-interest groups together\n\nWe'll send out a more detailed overview to the attendees before the meeting itself.\n\nNote that the attendance requirements for this track will be more strict than our critique and other meetings. This is because there is a far greater commitment required in critiquing an entire novel (though it won't be as intensive as for a short story, i.e. don't expect to give or be given line item edits or per-page notes).\n\nAs such, the novel track meetups (including this one) will be restricted to participants who:\n\n- have submitted and had their work critiqued at least once in the regular critique meetings\n\n- are *actively* working on a novel (in process, complete, in revision, etc.). As spaces are likely to be tight, people who aren't actively contributing both content and critiques will likely be asked to give up their spot for somebody who is. We won't be militant about this, but we will be fair.\n\n- are willing to commit to reading 5-10K/month (remembering that critiques for novels are not expected to be anywhere near as thorough as for short stories)\n\nThe idea behind this group is to be as much supportive/encouraging/inspiring as it is constructive (or maybe deconstructive).\n\nSo, if you want to contribute to the discussion of how we'll operate this group, join us on Mar. 15. Again, the above restrictions apply, so if you don't yet fit these requirements, please be patient and we'll find you a spot eventually!",

He is also a guest lecturer at Brunel University for their creative writing course.\n\nDen will be sharing his experiences with us on the trials and tribulations of writing novels, finding inspiration, the importance of community, among other wisdoms and truths. We'll be providing a selection of nibbles during the pre-gather chat, then Den will read a selection from his work and we'll follow with a question/answer period. All members are invited to attend.",

The sessions will begin at 7pm (no later), so this will give you plenty of time to find us and get yourself a drink at the bar.\n\nIn the first session there will be a FREE Penguin book for each person to take home and keep. In subsequent sessions, you’ll receive handouts, with guidance and pointers to help you improve your writing. In each session, we'll also provide some free snacks. This will help you enjoy your drink (and your writing) just that little bit more!\n\nWe’ll work together on character, perspective, tone, and dialogue, and instead of using a rigid plot structure, we’ll be using methods that encourage spontaneity.\n\nBy the end of the three weeks, you ought to have a fair amount written. We'll even invite you to publish all or part of it in our online journal (though, of course, you won't have to if you don't want to!).\n\n.....\n\nIf you want to make new friends, this event is for you.\n\nIf you want to make forays into a new, serious piece of writing, this event is for you.\n\nIf you want to have a beer or a glass of wine (during/after each session) and surprise yourself doing something fun and spontaneous, this event is for you!\n\n***THE GROUP IS FOR EVERYBODY FROM COMPLETE BEGINNERS TO SEASONED PROFESSIONALS. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY PRESSURE TO READ YOUR WORK IN FRONT OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE***\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to text or WhatsApp us on 07534 981 636.\n\nCan't wait to see you soon.\n\nCheers!\n\nSean\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: there is officially a no refund policy for this event.

        "description": "This is a special, SURREAL edition of the All Day Sesh!\n\nSurrealism is the most dramatic and thrilling of the modernist cultural movements of the 20s and 30s. It is best known for its dream-like visual artworks, but it’s writings are also magnificent, marked by strange juxtapositions, tangential ramblings, partial or broken meanings and oblique allusions to political or emotional states.\n\nTo work in the surrealist mode is to dream big, to unearth the most exciting and hidden elements of the unconscious, to access hitherto latent parts of what feels like a foreign part of the psyché.\n\nFor this special edition of the All Day Sesh! will be looking at parts of the surrealist manifesto by Andre Breton, some poems by Paul Eluard, some surrealist prose fiction, and examples of surrealism in contemporary writing. You will also have the opportunity to try surrealist writing for yourself!\n\n“Surrealism is destructive” said Salvador Dali, “but it destroys only what it considers to be shackles limiting our vision.”\n\nCome and join us and experience the mesmerising power of surrealist writing, first hand. Produce your own surrealist work. Take a leap into the unknown. Emerge changed and fascinate!\n\n***NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. ALL WILL BE REVEALED***\n\nThis event includes:\n\n1 x two-hour workshop (on SURREALISM IN LITERATURE)\n1 x free book\n1 x free breakfast\n1 x free tea or coffee\n3 x 40-minute writing sessions (with breaks in between)\n1 x free early evening drink\n1 x bunch of new writing buddies!\n\nAs always, this is a group for writers and non-writers, alike. No experience necessary. If you're already writing a novel - great! If you've never written anything in your life - that's also great!\n\n...\n\nMeet us at 10:45am at Finch's Pub in Old Street for a free breakfast.\n\nWhen we've had our breakfast and we're sipping tea or coffee, we’ll have a 2 hour workshop on SURREALISM IN LITERATURE.\n\nAt 1:30pm, we’ll sit down and have 3 x 40-minute writing sessions, using the Pomodorro technique (this means you'll get a 15-minute break between each stint of writing, and a chance to relax and confer with others, or whatever it is you feel like doing).\n\n*Note: there may be a tiny bit of background noise, but we’ll provide earplugs for you. Please bring your own headphones, if you’d prefer to use these.\n\nTo finish the day off, we'll go together for a FREE, early-evening drink in a bar (also very nearby).\n\nYou'll be more than welcome to have the one drink, or to sit and have another couple with the crew, for as long as people want to stay.\n\n...\n\nThis is a full day event (11am — 6pm, approx.)\n\n15 people, max.\n\nYou will never have to read your work in front of the group!\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: there is officially a no refund policy for this event. However, if you cancel a number of days in advance and we're able to refill your space, we will indeed refund you. Similarly, moving a cancelled RSVP over to a future event is contingent upon being able to refill the space that you vacate.",

You can use these writing sessions to work on your own thing, in your own time.\n\nAt the end of the day, we'll invite you to stay for a drink with the crew, to celebrate (though this is not compulsory).\n\nYou'll be more than welcome to just have the one drink, or to sit and have another couple with the crew, for as long as people want to stay.\n\n...\n\nIncluded in this event is:\n\n1 x two-hour workshop\n1 x free book\n1 x free breakfast\n3 x 40-minute writing sessions (with 15-minute breaks in between)\n1 x bunch of new writing buddies!\n\nThis is a full day event (11am — 6pm, approx.)\n\nYou will never have to read your work in front of the group!\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: there is officially a no refund policy for this event. However, if you cancel a number of days in advance and we're able to refill your space, we will indeed refund you. Similarly, moving a cancelled RSVP over to a future event is contingent upon being able to refill the space that you vacate.",

It is also an excellent example of the page-turning thriller.\n\n......................\n\nThe day itself will include:\n\n- a breakfast\n- a tea or coffee\n- a 2-hour workshop on story and setting\n- a hardback copy of Rubin's book, Liberation Square, which he will be happy to sign and/or dedicate for you!\n- a 1-hour lunch break\n- a casual, friendly Q&A with the author himself\n- an hour of reflective, personal writing, to consolidate what you've learned, and where you'd like to take your work from here\n- the opportunity to stay behind for an early evening drink!\n\n......................\n\nWe will meet at 10:45am, have breakfast together, followed by a 2-hour workshop on Rubin's writing, alongside some other examples of historical fiction, then a lunch break, before the author will join us for a friendly Q&A session. Once this is done, we will have an hour of quiet, reflective writing, so that you'll be able to get your ideas together and make any notes you'd like to make, on everything you've learned.\n\nIf you'd like to hear about the mechanics of a published author's approach to writing, this event is for you.\n\nIf you'd like to hear about a published author's experience of getting published, this event is for you.\n\nIf you'd like a signed, hardback copy of a bestselling, brilliantly reviewed historical fiction thriller, this event is for you.\n\n***NO EXPERIENCE OF WRITING IS NECESSARY FOR THIS EVENT***\n***BEGINNERS ARE ABSOLUTELY WELCOME***\n\nWe hope to see lots of your there!\n\n[*There are no refunds for this event].",

Then we’ll be using some playful writing prompts to get you writing in your own style.\n\nFor one night, forget the Queen’s grammar, forget Oxford syntax… be free to ramble away in the unique cadence of your own voice.\n\nYou will never be pressured to read your work aloud to the group, and you are not expected to have any knowledge of any particular dialect or slang.\n\nAs William Faulkner once said: “Write what you know”.\n\nIndeed: write what you know in the only voice you’ve ever known it: your own.\n\nIf you’d like to come to this workshop, you’ll receive:\n\n1 x free book\n1 x 2-hour workshop on slang and dialect in creative writing\n1 x free snacks\n1 x handout\n\n+ the invitation to stick around for an evening drink afterwards, to celebrate everything you’ve achieved.\n\nAs always please text or WhatsApp us on 07534 981 636 if you have any questions about this event (or any other), or if you would like to be added to our WhatsApp community for updates.\n\nDon’t be shy—we’d love to hear from you!\n\nCheers.\n\nSean :)",

It is for anybody interested in developing their style, of any level - beginners are absolutely, 100% more than welcome.\n\nIncluded in the event is:\n\n1 x free breakfast\n1 x 2-hour creative writing workshop on dating and creative writing (don't worry if you're not dating *right now* - you can draw on previous experience)\n1 x ***free, signed copy of Luke Tredget's novel Kismet***\n1 x lunch break\n1 x friendly Q&A session with Luke (about his novel, about style, about getting published, about dating apps, about... anything else we can think of to ask him on the day)\n1 x 40 minute private writing session, to put into practice everything you've learned\n+ the opportunity to stick around for an evening drink to celebrate!\n\nAs always, there is ***NEVER ANY PRESSURE TO READ YOUR WORK ALOUD IN FRONT OF THE GROUP... EVER***.\n\nAttendees will arrive at 10:45am, to begin at 11am. Here, we will take your breakfast + tea or coffee order. Then after breakfast, we will guide you through a series of playful creative writing exercises, so that you can begin to formulate your own ideas, in your own unique style.\n\nAfter breakfast and our 2-hour writing workshop, we will have a lunch break. After this, author Luke Tredget will arrive and we will reconvene for a friendly Q&A with him (*Note: don't worry. You won't be expected to ask questions or have anything to say. If nobody has any questions, you can just listen to Luke and your workshop host, Sean, in conversation about Luke's novel, Kismet, and about everything to do with publication, from writing approaches and style to finding an agent, sending off a manuscript and seeing your name in print).\n\nLuke has agreed that he will sign a free copy of his book for you, to take away and keep!\n\nIf you have any questions about this event (or any other), please don't hesitate to text or WhatsApp us on 07534 981 636 - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nWe hope to see you there for this incredible opportunity.\n\nUntil then...\n\nCheers! :)\n\n...........................................\n\nPraise for Luke's novel:\n\n\"Sharp, witty and full of tension...an intelligent and highly readable novel.\"―Irish Times\n\n\"Tredget's trenchant, entertaining debut traces how big data and social media have become an obstacle for healthy relationships...An incisive view of the uncertainties of contemporary adulthood.\"―Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Kismet is compelling for more than its unflinching study of the infiltration of romance by technology and algorithms. At its heart this novel is about what endures in spite of all that; a modern love story of exceptional warmth, intelligence and humanity.\"―Luke Kennard, author of The Transition\n\n\"Tredget writes a funny, timely story, with flawed and relatable characters, about how technology affects our desires and what it means to 'settle.' Though he satirizes modern dating and the idea of perfection in a relationship, he writes with an engaging warmth and lightness. Readers will surely enjoy this witty modern love story.\"―Booklist",

You can use these writing sessions to work on your own thing, in your own time.\n\nAt the end of the day, we'll invite you to stay for a drink with the crew, to celebrate (though this is not compulsory).\n\nYou'll be more than welcome to just have the one drink, or to sit and have another couple with the crew, for as long as people want to stay.\n\n...\n\nIncluded in this event is:\n\n1 x two-hour workshop\n1 x free book\n1 x free breakfast\n3 x 40-minute writing sessions (with 15-minute breaks in between)\n1 x bunch of new writing buddies!\n\nThis is a full day event (11am — 6pm, approx.)\n\nYou will never have to read your work in front of the group!\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: there is officially a no refund policy for this event.

We take each others' songs and songwriting and flesh them out from your bedroom solo acoustic pandemic playing to develop a wider session sound. We are a small independent local community of budding musicians who met and performed on the gig circuit and extend a welcome to budding musicians and acoustic singer-songwriters to develop as a community.\n\nHow long? - Usually 2 hours long acoustic music sessions limited to a max of 8 musicians. We work on shared and agreed music repertoire and play as an ensemble or session. Longer sessions break into improvisational jam sessions!\n\nWhere? We have our own private venue in the London borough of Lewisham with reasonable transport links. Those interested - get in touch. This is not a drop-in session.",

I have been running similar sessions for 2 years, the last year they have been online but now with the opening up of businesses, I would like to resume these sessions.\n\nWriting workshops have been great opportunities for writers to spend concentrated time on the pieces. We do not run feedback sessions but these groups create the opportunity for writers to share their work with others in a social environment. It can take away the loneliness out of writing and creates a fantastic opportunity to meet other writers. Not to mention the contagious effects of writing in silence alongside others.\n\nThe structure of the evening will consist of a short greeting, followed by writing in silence. At the end of the 2 hours, we will book a pub nearby and spend some time together sharing our own writing experience.\n\nI look forward to meeting all who want to come along.",

We do not run feedback sessions but these groups create the opportunity for writers to share their work with others in a social environment. It can take away the loneliness out of writing and create a fantastic opportunity to meet other writers. Not to mention the contagious effects of writing in silence alongside others.\n\nThe structure of the session will consist of a short greeting, followed by writing in silence. At the end of the 2 hours, writers it and socialise.\n\nI look forward to meeting all who want to come along, if at times I am not there talk to the other writers. This is an opportunity for you to write, i hope you enjoy and get lots of writing done.\n\nSinem",

        "description": "This is a free introductory class which prepares students for the intensive 8-week script bootcamp. In this introductory class on July 25, professional repped screenwriter Conor Kyle will teach you the process of taking an idea and developing it into a story, outline and complete feature screenplay first draft.\n\nBring up to 3 loglines / brand new script ideas! Conor is requesting that students use newer, fresher ideas, and stay away from the magnum opuses you've been working on or thinking about for years. The intention behind this camp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThis event will take place on the Script Camp Discord server: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\n8-Week Script Bootcamp Course Description:\nIn this eight-week live bootcamp, you’ll go from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay. You’ll attend one three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an 80 to 120-page script. Conor will make plenty of time to take questions from students, as well as to review your work and offer feedback. This is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 4: Beginnings\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

        "description": "Sunday Script Bootcamp is an intensive 8-week course that meets weekly on Sundays. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle walks you through the process of conceiving, outlining and writing a complete 80-120 page first draft, with personal feedback on your loglines, outlines and script pages.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nThis event will take place on discord: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• You can either purchase this course \"a la carte\" (enter coupon code MEETUP50 when you check out for $50 off): https://scriptcamp.net/product/script-bootcamp-sunday/\n• Or start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 4: Beginnings\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

        "description": "Sunday Script Bootcamp is an intensive 8-week course that meets weekly on Sundays. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle walks you through the process of conceiving, outlining and writing a complete 80-120 page first draft, with personal feedback on your loglines, outlines and script pages.\n\nWeek 4: Beginnings\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\nThis event will take place on discord: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• Simply start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

        "description": "This intensive six-week live bootcamp meets weekly on Saturdays (Sundays GMT+10/GMT+12) and continues every week through September 25. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\nThis is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nHow to enroll in the 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• You can either purchase the complete course \"a la carte\": https://scriptcamp.net/product/pilot-bootcamp/\n• Or start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 2: Structure and Broad Strokes\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nHow to enroll in the 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• You can either purchase the complete course \"a la carte\": https://scriptcamp.net/product/pilot-bootcamp/\n• Or start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasizes this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

This is a weekly workshop designed to help you refine your feature film logline or TV pilot logline.\n\nThis event is completely free and open to everyone. Space is limited, so be sure to hit the RSVP button. Then join us in the Workshop channel on discord ( https://discord.gg/kQfrX3R7Zy )\n\nIf you'd like to workshop your logline please post it in the #ideas-and-loglines channel on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/E2sDHGfwG8 ) along with your title, genre and comps, and we will review them in the order received.\n\nHere's an example logline template from Conor: “When (INCITING INCIDENT), a (ADJECTIVE) (PROTAGONIST) must (CONFLICT) before / or else (STAKES or TICKING CLOCK).”\n\nIt's difficult to perfect a logline by yourself. Usually this requires some help and feedback from fellow writers.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I have no idea how to create a logline. Is it okay if I just join to listen and learn?\nA: Absolutely! This workshop is entirely free and everyone is welcome to join.\n\nQ: What's the purpose of a logline?\nA: The logline is not only a way to get others interested in reading your script, but it's also an important step in the outlining and writing process. Usually it requires a little help from others to workshop a rough idea into a strong logline that seems like it can sustain a feature length story. And then it serves as your North star while developing the idea, constructing your outline, and writing the first draft\n\nQ: My writing is ____ genre, is that okay?\nA: Yes! Bring your logline for a feature film or TV Pilot (note that TV pilots require a series logline and pilot logline). Any genre is OK.\n\nQ: I'm worried that my logline sucks, should I still bring it?\nA: This is a process. Nobody will be perfect. We're here to support you, which means pointing out the parts that are awesome and providing honest feedback for improvement.\n\nQ: I still don't understand what a logline is, exactly.\nA: Here is a detailed write-up by Chris Lockhart about how to construct a logline: http://www.twoadverbs.com/logline.pdf",

        "description": "Welcome to Outline Workshop! This is a weekly workshop designed to help you refine your screenplay outline using Conor Kyle's practical story development process.\n\nThis event is completely free and open to everyone. Space is limited, so be sure to hit the RSVP button. Then join us in the Workshop channel on discord ( https://discord.gg/kQfrX3R7Zy )\n\nIf you'd like to workshop your outline please post it in the #outlines channel on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/Kv827aqw6q ) along with your title and logline and we will review them in the order received. You should already have a very solid logline and either a rough Story Beats Outline or a more detailed Scene Cards Outline. If you need help with your logline, please drop by the weekly Logline Workshop meetup on Friday.\n\nSee below a breakdown of the story development steps Conor teaches. If you complete each step properly, it makes the next step a lot easier:\n\n1. The first step is to take your rough idea and develop this into a solid logline that can sustain a feature film. (Or if this is a TV pilot, you need to develop a series logline and a pilot logline.) Here's an example logline template from Conor: “When (INCITING INCIDENT), a (ADJECTIVE) (PROTAGONIST) must (CONFLICT) before / or else (STAKES or TICKING CLOCK).” It's difficult to perfect a logline by yourself. Usually this requires some help and feedback from fellow writers.\n\n2. The second step is filling up your sketchbook. This can be google docs, Evernote, MS word, whatever you use for notes. Brainstorm lots of fun ideas for scenes, develop your theme, anti-theme and flesh out your characters. Whatever sort of notes and doodling process you need to develop your story. Some writers find it helpful to collect photos and artwork at this stage as well.\n\n3. The third step is to break out your story into beats and develop a Story Beats Outline with estimated pages for each section and a list of scenes. If you are writing a 90 page script, for example, your Story Beats Outline is going to have sections something like this, with a list of scene breakdowns in each section.\n\nIntro (1-10):\n\nCatalyst (10):\n\nDebate (10-20):\n\nBreak into 2 (20):\n\nFun and Games (20-45):\n\nMidpoint (45):\n\nBad Guys Close In (45-60):\n\nAll is Lost (60):\n\nDark Night of the Soul (61-70):\n\nBreak Into 3 (70):\n\nFinale (70-90):\n\n4. The next step is called a Scene Cards Outline. This is a detailed prose description of what happens in every single scene (not sluglines, but dramatic scenes), with estimated page count for each scene, dialogue excerpts and as much as you can of the action description that will end up in your first draft. This stage of your outlining process should feel more like writing than outlining. You are getting the heavy lifting out of the way, so that when you sit down to start the first draft, the pages are going to fly very quickly.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I have no idea how to create a screenplay outline. Is it okay if I just join to listen and learn?\nA: Absolutely! This workshop is entirely free and everyone is welcome to join.\n\nQ: My writing is ____ genre, is that okay?\nA: Yes! Bring your outline for a feature film or TV Pilot, whatever genre you're working on.\n\nQ: I don't have a solid logline yet.\nA: If you're having trouble with your logline, drop by our weekly Logline Workshop on Friday or post your logline in the #ideas-and-loglines channel for feedback on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/E2sDHGfwG8 ).\n\nQ: I'm worried that my outline sucks, should I still bring it?\nA: Rough drafts and outlines are always rough. Nobody will be perfect. We're here to support you, which means pointing out the parts that are awesome and providing honest feedback for improvement.",

        "description": "This intensive six-week live bootcamp meets weekly on Saturdays (Sundays GMT+10/GMT+12) and continues every week through September 25. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot. This is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nPlease note this class is not free. To join you must enroll in Unlimited Script Camp on our website.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nHow to enroll in the TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• Start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nWeek 2: Structure and Broad Strokes\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasizes this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

To join, you must enroll in Unlimited Script Camp on our website.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• Simply start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals).

He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.",

Space is limited, so be sure to hit the RSVP button. Then join us in the Workshop channel on Script Camp discord ( https://discord.gg/kQfrX3R7Zy )\n\nIf you'd like to workshop your outline please post it in the #outlines channel on the Script Camp discord ( https://discord.gg/Kv827aqw6q ) along with your title and logline and we will review them in the order received. You should already have a very solid logline and either a rough Story Beats Outline or a more detailed Scene Cards Outline. If you need help with your logline, please drop by the weekly Logline Workshop meetup on Friday.\n\nSee below a breakdown of the story development steps Conor teaches. If you complete each step properly, it makes the next step a lot easier:\n\n1. The first step is to take your rough idea and develop this into a solid logline that can sustain a feature film. (Or if this is a TV pilot, you need to develop a series logline and a pilot logline.) Here's an example logline template from Conor: “When (INCITING INCIDENT), a (ADJECTIVE) (PROTAGONIST) must (CONFLICT) before / or else (STAKES or TICKING CLOCK).” It's difficult to perfect a logline by yourself. Usually this requires some help and feedback from fellow writers.\n\n2. The second step is filling up your sketchbook. This can be google docs, Evernote, MS word, whatever you use for notes. Brainstorm lots of fun ideas for scenes, develop your theme, anti-theme and flesh out your characters. Whatever sort of notes and doodling process you need to develop your story. Some writers find it helpful to collect photos and artwork at this stage as well.\n\n3. The third step is to break out your story into beats and develop a Story Beats Outline with estimated pages for each section and a list of scenes. If you are writing a 90 page script, for example, your Story Beats Outline is going to have sections something like this, with a list of scene breakdowns in each section.\n\nIntro (1-10):\n\nCatalyst (10):\n\nDebate (10-20):\n\nBreak into 2 (20):\n\nFun and Games (20-45):\n\nMidpoint (45):\n\nBad Guys Close In (45-60):\n\nAll is Lost (60):\n\nDark Night of the Soul (61-70):\n\nBreak Into 3 (70):\n\nFinale (70-90):\n\n4. The next step is called a Scene Cards Outline. This is a detailed prose description of what happens in every single scene (not sluglines, but dramatic scenes), with estimated page count for each scene, dialogue excerpts and as much as you can of the action description that will end up in your first draft. This stage of your outlining process should feel more like writing than outlining. You are getting the heavy lifting out of the way, so that when you sit down to start the first draft, the pages are going to fly very quickly.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I have no idea how to create a screenplay outline. Is it okay if I just join to listen and learn?\nA: Absolutely! This workshop is entirely free and everyone is welcome to join.\n\nQ: My writing is ____ genre, is that okay?\nA: Yes! Bring your outline for a feature film or TV Pilot, whatever genre you're working on.\n\nQ: I don't have a solid logline yet.\nA: If you're having trouble with your logline, drop by our weekly Logline Workshop on Friday or post your logline in the #ideas-and-loglines channel for feedback on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/E2sDHGfwG8 ).\n\nQ: I'm worried that my outline sucks, should I still bring it?\nA: Rough drafts and outlines are always rough. Nobody will be perfect. We're here to support you, which means pointing out the parts that are awesome and providing honest feedback for improvement.",

        "description": "This intensive six-week live bootcamp meets weekly on Saturdays (Sundays GMT+10/GMT+12) and continues every week through September 25. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot. This is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nPlease note this class is not free. To join you must enroll in Unlimited Script Camp on our website.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nHow to enroll in the TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• Start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nWeek 2: Structure and Broad Strokes\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasizes this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "The eight-week Bootcamp runs June 24 through August 12. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\nThe intention behind this bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to join the 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* Please note this class is not free.\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: [https://scriptcamp.net/classes](https://scriptcamp.net/classes)\n* Or start your free trial $49 Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n* Then join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n***8-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Why this story? / Sketchbook (June 24)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. During this class, you’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the process of filling out your sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (July 1)**\nNow that you’ve filled out your sketchbook, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!",

        "description": "The complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly every Sunday. Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (July 31)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**\n• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/)\n• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n\n***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Loglines & Sketchbook (July 3)**\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (July 10)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (July 17)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 24)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (July 31)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Aug 7)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "The eight-week Bootcamp runs June 24 through August 12. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\nThe intention behind this bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to join the 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* Please note this class is not free.\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: [https://scriptcamp.net/classes](https://scriptcamp.net/classes)\n* Or start your free trial $49 Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n* Then join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n***8-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Why this story? / Sketchbook (June 24)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. During this class, you’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the process of filling out your sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (July 1)**\nNow that you’ve filled out your sketchbook, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!",

        "description": "The complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly every Sunday. Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Aug 7)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**\n• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/)\n• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n\n***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Loglines & Sketchbook (July 3)**\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (July 10)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (July 17)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 24)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (July 31)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Aug 7)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "The eight-week Bootcamp runs June 24 through August 12. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\nThe intention behind this bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n***How to join the 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:***\n\n* Please note this class is not free.\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: [https://scriptcamp.net/classes](https://scriptcamp.net/classes)\n* Or start your free trial $49 Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n* Then join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n***8-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Why this story? / Sketchbook (June 24)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. During this class, you’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the process of filling out your sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (July 1)**\nNow that you’ve filled out your sketchbook, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!",

Whether it’s a comedy sketch or dramatic vignette, you’ll study and explore short-form storytelling, then plan, draft, and revise a complete script by the end of the four-week course. Perfect for filmmakers seeking a project to shoot, or aspiring writers looking to start a collaboration with a director.\n\n#### ***About the Instructor:***\n\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder’s Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals).

        "description": "**How to Write a Movie!**\nThis class breaks down Conor Kyle's process for writing a screenplay in eight weeks. It all starts with your logline. Bring up to 3 loglines or brand new movie ideas! Conor is requesting that students use newer, fresher ideas, and stay away from the magnum opuses you’ve been working on or thinking about for years.\n\nThe intention behind the bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThe 8-week bootcamp starts August 21 and continues weekly through October 9. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos)** and **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)**\n\n**How to join the free class:**\n\n* Hit the RSVP button\n* Then join us on Discord: **[https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)**\n\n**How to join Conor's 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: **[https://scriptcamp.net/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/classes/)**\n* Or start the free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the new Script Camp Writers Lab: **[https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)**\n\n***8-Week Feature Bootcamp course schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (Sep 4)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 11)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (Sep 18)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (Sep 25)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (Oct 2)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (Oct 9)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? By the end of this week you will complete your 90-120 page first draft!",

        "description": "Ready to write a TV pilot? This free class provides an how to develop your pilot idea and write the script in six weeks. We’ll dive into the construction of your premise, characters and story world as you refine the concept for the project you will write during the intensive six-week TV Pilot Bootcamp. ***Bring your loglines and original show ideas!***\n\nThe complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly on Friday (US) / Saturdays (Australia/NZ). Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to enroll in the free class?**\n• Hit the RSVP button\n• Join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**\n• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/)\n• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n\n***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Loglines & Sketchbook (Aug 26)**\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (Sep 2)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (Sep 9)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 16)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (Sep 23)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Sep 30)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\nThe intention behind the bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThe 8-week bootcamp starts August 21 and continues weekly through October 9. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos)** and **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)**\n\n**How to join the free class:**\n\n* Hit the RSVP button\n* Then join us on Discord: **[https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)**\n\n**How to join Conor's 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: **[https://scriptcamp.net/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/classes/)**\n* Or start the free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the new Script Camp Writers Lab: **[https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)**\n\n***8-Week Feature Bootcamp course schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (Sep 4)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 11)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (Sep 18)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (Sep 25)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (Oct 2)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (Oct 9)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? By the end of this week you will complete your 90-120 page first draft!",

        "description": "Ready to write a TV pilot? This free class provides an how to develop your pilot idea and write the script in six weeks. We’ll dive into the construction of your premise, characters and story world as you refine the concept for the project you will write during the intensive six-week TV Pilot Bootcamp. ***Bring your loglines and original show ideas!***\n\nThe complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly on Friday (US) / Saturdays (Australia/NZ). Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to enroll in the free class?**\n• Hit the RSVP button\n• Join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**\n• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/)\n• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n\n***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Loglines & Sketchbook (Aug 26)**\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (Sep 2)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (Sep 9)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 16)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (Sep 23)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Sep 30)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nThe intention behind the bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThe 8-week bootcamp starts August 21 and continues weekly through October 9. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos)** and **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)**\n\n**How to join Conor's 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: **[https://scriptcamp.net/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/classes/)**\n* Or start the free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the new Script Camp Writers Lab: **[https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)**\n* Then join us on Discord: **[https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)**\n\n***8-Week Feature Bootcamp course schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (Sep 4)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 11)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (Sep 18)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (Sep 25)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (Oct 2)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (Oct 9)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? By the end of this week (Oct 16) you will complete your 90-120 page first draft!",

We've had some dramas with our favourite pub, The Carpenters Arms, which is no longer our little secret and has been booked out by all kinds of wacky groups (London Chess Society, anyone?).\n\nSo....we've moved our meet up night to Tuesday, 29th April. Hopefully the proximity to the start of the working week won't dissuade our staunch squadron of writers from attending! And it's still at our favourite little not-so-underground-anymore pub, The Carpenters Arms. 12 Seymour Place, a stone's throw from Marble Arch tube and Oxford Street Primark. Click here for a map (https://www.allinlondon.co.uk/mapping/map.php?pc=W1H+7NE)\n\nThe theme this time around is Climbing. Could be Social Climbing, Mountain Climbing, Climbing Plants, or just the eternal struggle to climb from one's bed each morning! Please note, the topic is applied very loosely and is just a guide! Your writing can come in many forms, poem, short story, puppet show, up to you! Please try to keep it to under 10 minutes in length, unless you're really good :)\n\nThe official start time is 8, but I'll be there just after 7 preparing everything. The Writer's Group is upstairs, so just navigate your way through the hoardes of rowdy public servants propping up the bar, up the trecherous staircase, through the dank, unlit corridors to our glorious creative sanctuary!\n\nOnce again, any questions, please email me: guy *underscore* kerr *at* hotmail.com.

        "description": "The new meetings will have a slightly different format to the old ones.\n\nFirst, there will be time-slots that people can use either to get feedback on a short piece of writing, or to describe a challenge they are facing (plot difficulties, etc) and get suggestions on that. From the poll (https://www.meetup.com/londonwriterscafe/polls/164322/), there is equal interest in both.\n\nSecond, there will be no set themes for the readings. I see the primary aim of the group as helping people with their existing work, so priority will be given to those who want feedback on a live project they are working on. Although I'll post a suggested theme each month, this is only for those who are not working on something of their own, and those readings will take a lower priority (ie. we'll come onto them if we have time).\n\nThe suggested theme, as befits a new year, is 'new beginnings'.

Funds are used for meetup fees, with any balance going into a pool to buy drinks for the assistant organisers.\n\nThis first meeting will run from 7.30-10pm to allow time for the volunteer co-organisers to meet beforehand; future meetings will run from 7-9.30pm.\n\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line:\nhttps://www.pubandbar-...

        "description": "London Writers Cafe is on again...\n\nLWC is a friendly get-together for London writers who want input, encouragement or feedback on their work. It's open to all writers; those who have just started to those who have had work published.\n\nBTW - At this one, I'll be doing a quick session on online marketing techniques every writer can use. This will include; websites to post your work and build a following, how to start and use a blog, search engine marketing, social networks and how to find your audience.\n\nThen we'll get back to regular schedule programming...\n\nThe meeting consists of six time-slots of 20 minutes. You can use this slot in whatever way would help your writing.\n\nYou might want to:\n- read (or bring) a short piece of writing and get feedback on it\n- describe a plot problem and get input on it\n- get ideas on how to break through writers' block\n- hear about writing events, news and website tools to use\n- network with other writers\n\nPlease bring ten copies for group members to share. If you don't have access to a printer, don't worry - please email it to me and I'll print copies for you.\n\nIf you are doing a reading, bear in mind that your total slot is 20 minutes, so I recommend your reading maximum of 10 minutes and allowing sufficient time for group feedback.\n\nSlots are booked on the night on a first-come, first-served basis. Please email me asap if you'd like a spot. We get booked up fast these days!\n\nCosts: £2 per session; paying by cash on the night or PayPal is set up when you RSVP.\n\nLocation:\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line.\n\nDirections: Take the Bishopsgate exit from the main rail concourse, cross the road, turn left and Middlesex Street is 2nd right. The pub is about 100 metres down on the right-hand side, and we meet in the function room downstairs.\n\nPlease call or text me on 07967175578 if you need directions.\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone again :)\n\nbest,\nLisa (LWC Crowd Controller)",

We'll also have an fiction editor from HarperCollins UK followed by a panel discussion of Q&As from the audience.\nThis event aims to unveil some of the most common myths around getting published and tips from those who have made it\n\nA bit more about our guest authors:\nSue Moorcroft (https://www.suemoorcroft.com/)\nIn her own words: I'm a writer. I spend most of the week - and part of the weekend, and also some evenings - writing, mainly romantic fiction. The family are used to me and no-one ever suggests I get A Proper Job.\n\nKaren Mahoney (https://kazmahoney.com/)\nIn her own words: I write mostly for young adults, but have a number of projects underway and am always looking to challenge myself with new things. Visit the Books section to learn more about my forthcoming publications and works in progress. My first YA novel, The Iron Witch, will be published in the US in February 2011 and in Australia, March 2011.\n\nLeigh Russell (https://leighrussell.blogspot.com/)\nCUT SHORT, her first novel, has broken sales records in bookshops around the UK. A schedule of her other appearances can be found on her publisher's website.\nIn her own words: You may have heard me interviewed on one of many BBC Radio stations, or seen me featured or quoted in a newspaper. I am a member of the Curzon Group and post regularly on their blog. ROAD CLOSED, the second in the series, will be published in June 2010.\n\nLaura Deacon, Fiction Editor\nWe'll also have Laura Deacon, editor at Blue Door Books (https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/about-harpercollins/Imprints/blue-door/Pages/Blue-Door.aspx), talking about the submission and publishing process. She'll also be there to answer questions from guests from an editorial perspective.\n\nSpaces will be capped at 40 people so please RSVP early.\nThe normal meetup time has changed to 6:30 so we have enough time to get through the talks and get to question time. As a courtesy to the speakers, please be on time.\n\nPlease feel free to invite friends to this meetup and share the event on your social networks, if you have them :)\n\nActive members of LWC will be given first priority. A £6.50 charge for this event will be to cover costs of the speakers attending. Please pay by PayPal when you RSVP or email me that you'd rather pay on the night in cash.\n\nAny questions, please get in touch by email. Hopefully, this event will be just as successful as the last one!\n\nLocation and direction details:\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line.\nTake the Bishopsgate exit from the main rail concourse, cross the road, turn left and Middlesex Street is 2nd right.

You're very welcome to come along to listen as you'll not be asked to contribute to the group feedback until you decide to do so.

We ensure that all writing feedback is constructive and respectful and we've been running these workshops as a safe place for writers since 2006.\n\nIf you'd like to read, please post a comment below. Spots are given on a first ask, first given basis with a couple of reserve spots. You must have booked your place before making a request to read.\n\nIf you are reading, please bring 5-10 copies of your pages so members can make additional editing notes for you during the reading. Please notify us by commenting below if you have to pull out of reading after your place has been confirmed. Pulling out too many times may result in us refusing your next request to read.\n\nTICKETS: £8.50 and please follow the steps to pay via PayPal when you RSVP\n\nNOTE: Refunds will only be provided if the meetup is cancelled by us.

        "description": "**A creative writing workshop exclusively for writers who have NEVER BEEN to any of our other events before, please feel welcome!** We're putting on this event for any writer who finds it comforting to know that everyone there is a newbie like them. We understand how daunting it can be to enter a group where others know each other so we're trying this out!\nIn this workshop, we invite two first-timers attending to read a piece of their work (up to 3,000 words) for feedback, advice and encouragement from the rest of the group. We can offer feedback on any storytelling form - part of a novel, short stories, screenplays or scripts - so long as it is under the word count. All feedback is constructive and respectful and moderated by your host. We've been holding these sessions as a safe space for writers of all kinds since 2006.\n\nAn example of what constructive feedback looks like: *'I liked this section for its energy, but have you thought about pacing it differently in this bit? I found it lagged because of too many adjectives.**'***\nWe always refer to what's on the page to give specific examples on the strengths and weaknesses of the storytelling or writing. Feedback is never personal nor offered without some evidence wherever possible.\n\nYou're very welcome to come along to listen, as you'll not be asked to contribute to the group feedback until you decide to do so. Observe first and contribute whenever you want to, that's completely all right by us. You'll be surprised by how much you can learn by listening to others' work and feedback.\n\nFor people reading, pieces must be 3,000 words or less as you'll have 35mins in total to read your piece and hear the feedback from the group. For the rest of the time, we'll spend talking about our writing projects, struggles and goals, so this session will be more relaxed than our regular workshops. Normally, we'll gather in the bar after the session for a few drinks and a chat too.\n\n**If you'd like to read at this workshop,** please post a (the) comment below (in the event discussion) *'I'd like to read'* and we'll confirm. Spots are given on a first ask, first given basis, with a reserve spot in case someone drops out. If you are reading, please bring 5-10 copies of your pages so the others can make additional notes and comments for you during the reading. Please notify us ASAP by commenting below if you have to pull out of reading after your place has been confirmed.\n\nYou must have booked your place before making a request to read.\n\nTICKETS: £8.50 and please follow the steps to pay via PayPal when you book your place.

        "description": "Drop in to this exclusive discussion and Q&A with Elaine Bousfield of Zuntold Publishing, a new-ish publisher based in Manchester, as she talks about publishing middle grade and young adult fiction that supports mental health and her relentless search for new talent.\n\nElaine's plan is to publish books that emphasise some aspect of our mental health which means she's actively looking for new authors writing books with a story, character or setting that tackles or touches on the issues around our mental wellbeing, capacity and behaviour. Ideally, beautifully written stories with a lot of heart. If you think your book might be a good fit please do come along and find out more.\n\n[ZunTold](https://www.zuntold.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=8) is an independent publishing company, based in Manchester, focusing on publishing good fiction to support mental health and wellbeing. They publish Middle Grade and YA fiction and love working with established voices as well as debut authors. Their authors have been nominated for literary prizes, including the Carnegie Medal, and won prestigious awards too, like the Lancashire Book of the Year Award, chosen solely by young people aged 13-14 years of age. They regularly work with agented authors, but, twice a year, they open our doors to unagented authors of Young Adult (YA) in June and Middle Grade in December. They don't publish picture books at the present time.\n\nThis workshop is suitable for writers of all levels.\n\nCosts: £10 per person.

If you simply want to read and provide writers with feedback, please join this meetup!\n\nWe've got a DropBox folder where I will upload excerpts for the meetup. The idea is that readers will download and read the work prior to the event in order to give in depth feedback. If you wish to participate, I will need your email address to send you the link. You can send me a direct message with that info. If I have your email info already I'll send the link (if you plan on joining us).\n\nOne of our members has already graciously offered to go first, but there's space for 1 - 2 more writers! First come first serve, so please indicate your interest in the comments.\n\nExcerpt Guidelines:\n- Kindly forward your excerpt to me by January 7th to give everyone enough time to read it by January 17th.\n- Try to keep the excerpt at around 3000 words (12 - 13 pages double spaced). There is, of course, some flexibility to this (for example, you have a chapter that's 15 pages or a short story closer to 4000 words, etc.).\n- What kind of feedback are you looking for? Provide this info in a comment. It will help us readers to know what to focus on.\n\nLooking forward to giving this a go . . . see you there!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES: Feedback MUST be constructive. If you read a member's work it is understood that it is confidential and you will not share that members work publicly (or elsewhere). All members are responsible for their food and drink.",

A frequent topic was what books we’d read and that is what we’ll be concentrating on tonight.\n\nMany of us have been fascinated by the copiously filled bookcases behind the interviewees that we’ve seen during lockdown so we thought we’d ask you to bring a book along and introduce it to us. If you haven’t got the actual book just the name and author are fine. Give us a brief description of what it is about and anything else you want to say about it - what it meant to you, or what the writing was like.\n\nThen we will open it up to a brief discussion- has anyone else read it, what did they get out of it or did they not get on with it. Does it remind us of other books. Would we like to read it? We’ll keep the time for each book to about ten minutes and any extra time at the end for more discussion. Do bring your own snacks and drink.\n\nHappy reading 📖! Irene",

Anyone that doesn't get a turn this time we will prioritize for the next one.\n\nWhat do I read to the group? Anything you have written - a work in progress; a first draft; a finished piece. Anything that you'd like to share and get some immediate responses to.\n\nDo I submit my work in advance? No, the object of the exercise is to get an immediate first impression response from members after you read the piece out.\n\nThe aim is to encourage our writing by having this space to share it and getting some spontaneous responses. We ask as always that this should be constructive and positive. It will be great to hear what we’re all working on.\n\nPlease note this will not be the same as our more formal feedback sessions where we submit a more substantial piece (up to 3000 words) in advance, giving everyone a chance to study it properly and give considered and detailed feedback.",

In these online writing events we follow the format of our regular writing meetups (see below).\n\nTo do so, I will end the Zoom component of the meeting after 20 to 30 minutes so that we can all write for an hour without the feeling of being spied upon through our webcams! I will then restart the Zoom meeting and you will be able to re-join using the same link.\n\nWhat to expect: We'll start off the meeting with introductions and a bit of a chat (which usually runs to about 30 minutes). I will then introduce a writing prompt for us all to follow, a jumping off point to act as a guide for the writing session. What you do with it, where you go with it, is entirely up to you! We'll write for about an hour, after which we can talk about where our writing took us and maybe share some of what we produced.\n\nNo pressure, though - only share whatever you feel comfortable with. (We do have a more formal feedback meeting that you can submit pieces to for review - check our upcoming events for more details.)",

Writing can be a bit lonely, so this way we make it more sociable and also force ourselves to get on with it! We all just work on our own projects- no set writing exercises or anything.\n\nNote: As we're spending quite a while in the pub, they do like us to buy food. We don't have a proper group meal but if you fancy a sandwich or desert at some point during the writing session, then you can order one.",

This will help you to get the most from a critique of your own work.",

It’s more about getting some perspective, seeing what your options are (realising that you have some), and giving yourself some space to work out what you’d like to do next, if anything.\n\nOne session might be enough, or you might feel the benefit of coming more regularly.\n\nThis group is not suitable for replacement of individual/group therapeutic work, but can be a great complement to it.\n\nAbout me\nI'm passionate about sharing life writing techniques including free writing, encouraging people to help (and be OK with) themselves and know that we’re never alone if we have a pen in our hand. I am a coach and facilitator and use writing to help uncover sometimes surprising, but always useful perspectives and insights.\n\nMore info at: cpsdayoff.com",

It’s more about capturing a feeling or a tone that can guide our decisions and help us feel that, whilst we might not always be behind the wheel, we’re at least in the front of the car. I've been using annual themes for nearly 10 years now and I can say that they have really helped me.\n\nFree writing is a great tool for uncovering new insights and perspectives and a lovely way to celebrate your ‘you-ness’. No writing talent, knowledge or experience – and definitely no grammar – is required.\n\nDetails\nDate: 12 January 2019\nTime: 1-4pm\nCost is £25.00 (includes tea, coffe and biscuits)\nVenue: Vauxhall Gardens Community Centre is less than a five minute walk from the tube/train/bus station.\n\nThere will be a maximum of 12 people at the workshop but as tickets are being booked through Eventbrite, I'll update the number of available slots as I go along, so the number here to sign up will change.

Journaling is incredibly useful and has many, many benefits. Journaling with others takes things to another level. As well as the accountability of writing with other people, we tend to write differently; often more, than we would on our own. Sharing is at the core of this session (in pairs). It doesn't have to be what you wrote word for word, it could just be how the exercise was for you and anything noteworthy you'd like to share. The writing prompts will help you to surface new insights and ideas, giving you clues as to what needs to happen in your life to get you where you want to be, or just to make it more enjoyable. Best of all, no writing talent, knowledge or experience - and definitely no grammar - is required.\n\nThis session will:\n\n* A chance to 'try before you buy' (my other workshops)\n* Give you some time, just for you\n* Give you the opportunity to do some writing (from prompts)\n* Give you some headspace, perspective and insight\n* Connect you to yourself and others.\n* Give you a lovely shared experience with like minded souls\n\nIt’s creative, supportive and fun, so why not come along and give it a go. You'll leave with some insights, some headspace and satisfaction of an hour well spent, in good company.\n\nPLEASE NOTE you'll need to register via the Zoom link - this is for security purposes. Thank you.\n\nThese session are free, but if you'd like to buy me a coffee (or a Ko-fi!) click here: https://ko-fi.com/cpsdayoff thanks!\n\nI've been running writing workshops and coaching for over three years and run regular sessions giving people the opportunity to write, grow and have fun together.

        "description": "It’s like journaling, but with other people! Trust me, it’s fun, energising, inspiring, supportive, rewarding and creative too.​\n\nJournaling with others takes things to another level. As well as the accountability of writing with other people, we tend to write differently; often more, than we would on our own.\n\nWe use free-writing prompts to get writing. It could be a new season, a painting or National Penguin Day that we take for our inspiration in this session. It’s all just a place to start and then explore what comes through in our writing, whether that's creative, straight journaling or a combination of both.\n\nWriting and sharing (always optional) never fails to connect those taking part in the joys and challenges of being human. It can also be a lot of fun and a great creative outlet.\n\nBest of all, no writing talent, knowledge or experience - and definitely no grammar - is required.\n\nSessions are great for stress relief, building confidence, and uncovering different perspectives and sometimes surprising insights. It’s also a lovely way to celebrate your ‘you’-ness and realise that you're never alone when you have a pen in your hand.​\n\nThis session will:\n\n* Give you some lovely 'you time' to connect with yourself, and others\n* Get you writing - journaling/creative/both\n* Give you headspace, perspective and insight\n* Give you a lovely shared experience with like- minded souls\n\nI've been running writing workshops and coaching since 2018 and run regular sessions giving people the opportunity to write, grow and have fun together.

Journaling is incredibly useful and has many, many benefits. Journaling with others takes things to another level. As well as the accountability of writing with other people, we tend to write differently; often more, than we would on our own. Sharing is at the core of this session (in pairs). It doesn't have to be what you wrote word for word, it could just be how the exercise was for you and anything noteworthy you'd like to share. The writing prompts will help you to surface new insights and ideas, giving you clues as to what needs to happen in your life to get you where you want to be, or just to make it more enjoyable. Best of all, no writing talent, knowledge or experience - and definitely no grammar - is required.\n\nThis session will:\n\n* A chance to 'try before you buy' (my other workshops)\n* Give you some time, just for you\n* Give you the opportunity to do some writing (from prompts)\n* Give you some headspace, perspective and insight\n* Connect you to yourself and others.\n* Give you a lovely shared experience with like minded souls\n\nIt’s creative, supportive and fun, so why not come along and give it a go. You'll leave with some insights, some headspace and satisfaction of an hour well spent, in good company.\n\nPLEASE NOTE you'll need to register via the Zoom link - this is for security purposes.

Normal price £49.\n\n**Coach yourself with a Pen - at work and at home**\nUsing techniques from creative writing, journaling, and coaching, you'll connect to yourself more deeply and work through your own live example. You'll leave feeling inspired and energised with some clear next steps and a set of new tools.\n\nYou may just have some fun too whilst tapping into your creativity, which will build your creative confidence. Everyone is creative when it comes to ideas and solutions and these tools will empower you to make the most of bigger opportunities and goals you'd like to achieve.\n\nBringing out your creativity is not only good for your wellbeing and your career (it's one of the most important skills companies need according to LinkedIn and other studies), but it can also give you meaning, help you to solve problems, be more curious about the world around you and ultimately, have a more enjoyable life and feel more confident.\n\nThe tools I'll introduce you to are easy to use, accessible 24/7, playful, creative and great for creating headspace, surfacing new perspectives and facing fear and anxiety to help you get what you want in your life. No experience, interest and definitely no grammar are required.\n\nThese tools are also great for divergent thinking and are really well suited for Design Thinking and Agile ways of working, whether for innovation or reaching goals. They can work with small or large challenges or goals and are suitable for all levels.\n\n**Session one, 21 September**, will be about getting to the bottom of what's happening and what it is you want to achieve/overcome.\n**Session two, 28 September**, will be all about looking forward to what you want and where you want to be.\n\nZoom details are revealed once you book.\n\nI've been running writing workshops and coaching since 2018 and run regular sessions giving people the opportunity to write, grow and have fun together.

It’s also a lovely way to celebrate your ‘you’-ness and realise that you're never alone when you have a pen in your hand.​\n\nThis session will:\n\\* Give you some lovely headspace to focus on what you want\n\\* Give you some lovely 'you time' to connect with yourself, and others\n\\* Get you writing - journaling/creative/both\n\\* Give you headspace, perspective and insight\n\\* Give you a lovely shared experience with like- minded souls\n\nZoom details are revealed once you book.\n\nI've been running writing workshops and coaching since 2018 and run regular sessions giving people the opportunity to write, grow and have fun together.

Journaling is incredibly useful and has many, many benefits. Journaling with others takes things to another level. As well as the accountability of writing with other people, we tend to write differently; often more, than we would on our own. Sharing is at the core of this session (in pairs). It doesn't have to be what you wrote word for word, it could just be how the exercise was for you and anything noteworthy you'd like to share. The writing prompts will help you to surface new insights and ideas, giving you clues as to what needs to happen in your life to get you where you want to be, or just to make it more enjoyable. Best of all, no writing talent, knowledge or experience - and definitely no grammar - is required.\n\nThis session will:\n\n* A chance to 'try before you buy' (my other workshops)\n* Give you some time, just for you\n* Give you the opportunity to do some writing (from prompts)\n* Give you some headspace, perspective and insight\n* Connect you to yourself and others.\n* Give you a lovely shared experience with like minded souls\n\nIt’s creative, supportive and fun, so why not come along and give it a go. You'll leave with some insights, some headspace and satisfaction of an hour well spent, in good company.\n\nPLEASE NOTE you'll need to register via the Zoom link - this is for security purposes. Thank you.\n\nThese session are free, but if you'd like to buy me a coffee (or a Ko-fi!) click here: https://ko-fi.com/cpsdayoff thanks!\n\nI've been running writing workshops and coaching for over three years and run regular sessions giving people the opportunity to write, grow and have fun together.

Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. You will never have to read your work in front of the group – it will merely be discussed by the group in a friendly, constructive manner (a manner consistent with a blueprint for critique that I will set out in week 3). Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

        "description": "The full price for this course is £60 (super early-bird price = £50). That's equivalent to £12 (or cheaper) for each two-hour session (+ at the end of the 5 weeks, you will have the opportunity to PUBLISH YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE.\n\nIf you would like to do this course online, please contact the organiser first.\n\n...\n\nPod No. 1 (beginners) 5-week short story course\n\n[There will only be 6 places in a Pod. Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

Things like:\n\n• Line breaks\n\n• Stanza formation\n\n• Rhythm\n\n• Free verse\n\nBy the end of the day, you'll have a small handful of your own poems, either complete or to take home and work on.\n\nIf you're an intermediate level poet, this workshop will also be enormously beneficial to you. We'll be generating ideas together and you'll have the fixed structure of the day to compel your progress!\n\nAny questions, don't hesitate to ask (either reply here or text Sean on: 07534 981 636).\n\nHope to see you soon! :)",

At the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH PART OF YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nPOD-101: “THE ADVANCED COURSE”\n\nThe aim of this course is for you to plan and write a novel.\n\nWeek 1. (Planning your novel)\n\nIn the first week, you’ll be generating an idea for your novel. You will then flesh-out/develop this idea using a narrative arc. This arc will ensure that you’re able to produce a compelling and dynamic story for whomever your readership is intended to be. You can take the arc home, develop and/or discard it, depending on your personal preference. Either way, the arc is an essential aspect of good storytelling, and the strategy you receive here will benefit your writing immensely.\n\nWeek 2. (Narrative Perspective + Chapters 1 & 2)\n\nIn the second week, you’ll be invited to plan your first two chapters, in greater depth. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will help you decide which narrative perspective (and which tense) to write your novel in.\n\nWeek 3. (Dialogue + Chapters 3, 4 & 5)\n\nIn the third week, you’ll be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will ensure you’re using dialogue effectively in your work.\n\nWeek 4. (Feedback + Chapters 6, 7 & 8)\n\nIn the fourth week, you will receive feedback for up to 3000 words of the writing you have done so far. You will also be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters.\n\nWeek 5. (Feedback + Chapters 9 & 10 + Re-visiting the arc)\n\nIn the final week, you will plan and/or write your 9th & 10th chapter. You will also re-visit the narrative arc you made for your work at the beginning of the course. This will enable you to consolidate a final first draft or plan for your entire novel.\n\n***Note: your novel may not be precisely 10 chapters. This is, of course, entirely up to you. POD-101/THE ADVANCED COURSE is here to provide you a 5-week structure within which to complete as much of your novel as possible. If you’re extremely motivated, you may finish an entire first draft. Most people, however, will produce an entire plan/outline + only *some* of their first draft. Either way, POD-101 will be running on a rolling basis. So you will have the opportunity to RSVP again for the next 5-weeks, and continue working on your novel. To avoid the workshop becoming stale and un-productive, participants should not sign up for more than two consecutive POD-101’s.\n\nIf you would like to do this course, but you have some questions, please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.",

        "eventUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/the-new-machine-creative-writing/events/245107516",
        "description": "The full price for this course is £60. That's equivalent to £12 for each two-hour session (+ you will have multiple opportunities to receive feedback on your work. At the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH PART OF YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nPOD-101: “THE ADVANCED COURSE”\n\nThe aim of this course is for you to plan and write a novel.\n\nWeek 1. (Planning your novel)\n\nIn the first week, you’ll be generating an idea for your novel. You will then flesh-out/develop this idea using a narrative arc. This arc will ensure that you’re able to produce a compelling and dynamic story for whomever your readership is intended to be. You can take the arc home, develop and/or discard it, depending on your personal preference. Either way, the arc is an essential aspect of good storytelling, and the strategy you receive here will benefit your writing immensely.\n\nWeek 2. (Narrative Perspective + Chapters 1 & 2)\n\nIn the second week, you’ll be invited to plan your first two chapters, in greater depth. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will help you decide which narrative perspective (and which tense) to write your novel in.\n\nWeek 3. (Dialogue + Chapters 3, 4 & 5)\n\nIn the third week, you’ll be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will ensure you’re using dialogue effectively in your work.\n\nWeek 4. (Feedback + Chapters 6, 7 & 8)\n\nIn the fourth week, you will receive feedback for up to 3000 words of the writing you have done so far. You will also be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters.\n\nWeek 5. (Feedback + Chapters 9 & 10 + Re-visiting the arc)\n\nIn the final week, you will plan and/or write your 9th & 10th chapter. You will also re-visit the narrative arc you made for your work at the beginning of the course. This will enable you to consolidate a final first draft or plan for your entire novel.\n\n***Note: your novel may not be precisely 10 chapters. This is, of course, entirely up to you. POD-101/THE ADVANCED COURSE is here to provide you a 5-week structure within which to complete as much of your novel as possible. If you’re extremely motivated, you may finish an entire first draft. Most people, however, will produce an entire plan/outline + only *some* of their first draft. Either way, POD-101 will be running on a rolling basis. So you will have the opportunity to RSVP again for the next 5-weeks, and continue working on your novel. To avoid the workshop becoming stale and un-productive, participants should not sign up for more than two consecutive POD-101’s.\n\nIf you would like to do this course, but you have some questions, please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.",

        "eventUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/the-new-machine-creative-writing/events/246750544",
        "description": "The full price for this course is £60. That's equivalent to £12 for each two-hour session (+ you will have multiple opportunities to receive feedback on your work. At the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH PART OF YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nPOD-101: “THE ADVANCED COURSE”\n\nThe aim of this course is for you to plan and write a novel.\n\nWeek 1. (Planning your novel)\n\nIn the first week, you’ll be generating an idea for your novel. You will then flesh-out/develop this idea using a narrative arc. This arc will ensure that you’re able to produce a compelling and dynamic story for whomever your readership is intended to be. You can take the arc home, develop and/or discard it, depending on your personal preference. Either way, the arc is an essential aspect of good storytelling, and the strategy you receive here will benefit your writing immensely.\n\nWeek 2. (Narrative Perspective + Chapters 1 & 2)\n\nIn the second week, you’ll be invited to plan your first two chapters, in greater depth. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will help you decide which narrative perspective (and which tense) to write your novel in.\n\nWeek 3. (Dialogue + Chapters 3, 4 & 5)\n\nIn the third week, you’ll be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will ensure you’re using dialogue effectively in your work.\n\nWeek 4. (Feedback + Chapters 6, 7 & 8)\n\nIn the fourth week, you will receive feedback for up to 3000 words of the writing you have done so far. You will also be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters.\n\nWeek 5. (Feedback + Chapters 9 & 10 + Re-visiting the arc)\n\nIn the final week, you will plan and/or write your 9th & 10th chapter. You will also re-visit the narrative arc you made for your work at the beginning of the course. This will enable you to consolidate a final first draft or plan for your entire novel.\n\n***Note: your novel may not be precisely 10 chapters. This is, of course, entirely up to you. POD-101/THE ADVANCED COURSE is here to provide you a 5-week structure within which to complete as much of your novel as possible. If you’re extremely motivated, you may finish an entire first draft. Most people, however, will produce an entire plan/outline + only *some* of their first draft. Either way, POD-101 will be running on a rolling basis. So you will have the opportunity to RSVP again for the next 5-weeks, and continue working on your novel. To avoid the workshop becoming stale and un-productive, participants should not sign up for more than two consecutive POD-101’s.\n\nIf you would like to do this course, but you have some questions, please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.",

Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

        "description": "[The Day of Poetry is normally £20. This time it is £15 for the 4 hour session, so that's only £3.75 per hour!!!]\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\nHi there,\n\nIf you're a poet (or if you'd like to be!) please RSVP and come along to The New Machine's \"DAY OF POETRY\".\n\nIf you're a complete beginner, no problem. Throughout the 4-hour session, we'll be learning the poetry basics, from scratch. Things like:\n\n• Line breaks\n\n• Stanza formation\n\n• Rhythm\n\n• Free verse\n\nWe will be looking at poetry by Samuel Beckett, Sharon Olds, Margaret Atwood, Frank O'Hara, Langston Hughes, Matsuo Basho, and William Shakespeare.\n\nBy the end of the day, you'll have a small handful of your own poems, either complete or to take home and work on.\n\nIf you're an intermediate level poet, this workshop will also be enormously beneficial to you. We'll be generating ideas together and you'll have the fixed structure of the day to compel your progress!\n\nAny questions, don't hesitate to ask (either reply here or text Sean on: 07534 981 636).\n\nHope to see you soon! :)",

This is hard to do alone\". – Zadie Smith***\n\n...\n\nLet's get together and learn how to write the perfect beginning.\n\nWhether you've already written your novel/short story or you're starting something afresh, this is the perfect workshop to hone your style, tone, tempo, and general approach.\n\nWe'll be looking at everybody from Zadie Smith to John Cheever, Francois Sagan to Katherine Mansfield, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie to Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nWe'll be looking at what agents and publishers might want from the opening chapter.\n\nWe'll be setting you up with some fun, exciting writing exercises, to make sure you get the chance to finesse your approach and leave with something new and brilliant, ready to take home and edit.\n\nFirst of all though, we'll be ordering teas, coffees and brunch, before we settle in for a warm-up exercise, to get our imaginations flowing.\n\nNo experience of writing is necessary for this workshop.\n\nNo pressure to read or share your work with the group.\n\nJust sit back, listen, learn, read, write, eat, drink, and come away full of new knowledge and expertise in the art of writing.\n\n***\"The scariest moment is always just before you start\". – Stephen King***\n\nSo please feel free to text us on 07534 981 636 if you have any questions at all - we'll be more happy to help :)",

Simply, an agent can fast-track your manuscript on to the desk of the right commissioning editor who will give it serious consideration.\n\nAnd then there's negotiating the advance, contracts, sale of TV and film rights... all the stuff that can keep you from getting on with your next book/script/poetry collection/play!\n\nBut how do you find an agent? How do you know what they're looking for? How do you know what you should be asking them?\n\nGuy Rose of FRA Literary Agents has three decades of experience, representing authors of books, film and TV scripts and stage plays. In conversation with FRA client and Sutton Writers member Simon Woodham, he'll be giving us an insider's view on the current state of publishing and more. And there will be time for you to put your own questions during and after the discussion.\n\n**********\n\nNEW MEMBERS ALWAYS WELCOME\n\nMembers: The full annual membership fee includes admission to our monthly meeting. It also covers in-house competitions, attendance at workshops and other writing events. This represents very good value particularly for those who participate in the free workshops where they can benefit from the knowledge and expertise of other writers.\n\nVisitors and Country / Online Members: You can attend your first monthly meeting free of charge.

We won’t be chatting or reading each other’s work to give feedback, just sitting together to work individually on our own projects.\n\nIf you’re bringing a laptop, make sure it’s fully charged as there may not be plugs available. Then grab yourself a drink and join us!\n\nIf you’d like to come, we will be in the Cock & Bull pub at the top of Sutton high street. Please RSVP on Meetup so Paul knows how big a table to book.\n\nHope to see you there!",

        "description": "Sutton Writers are very pleased to have Lucy Furlong join us to talk about the amazing Annie Kenney and the 100 DAYS project, which has highlighted so many stories and given new perspectives into people's lives during the First World War.\n\nIn partnership with the Imperial War Museum, the 100 DAYS project engaged 100 volunteer writers from 26 Characters Ltd, a not-for-profit organisation representing a diverse group of people who share a love of words. Each writer created a 100 word piece (a centena) inspired by and based on the life of a real individual who experienced the First World War. The centenas are being released daily, from 5th August to 12th November, each day showcasing the work of different members of the Partnership.\n\nLucy Furlong chose Annie Kenney, the only working class suffragette on the board of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Her challenge was to give Annie her voice, and in 100 words, show her vital contribution to women getting the vote in 1918.\n\nLucy Furlong's centena was published on August 11th, along with a film of her reading her poem in the Peace Garden at the Imperial War Museum.\n\nWeb link here:\n\nhttp://www.1914.org/armistice-100-days/centenas/votes-for-women-by-lucy-furlong/\n\n**********\n\nNEW MEMBERS ALWAYS WELCOME\n\nMembers: The full annual membership fee includes admission to our monthly meeting.

It's protected time for creativity, with the bonus of having others in the same boat alongside you. You won't be reading out any work - you can keep it totally to yourself - and there won't be any guest speakers. This is really just about getting words on a page.\n\nBring yourself, your laptop/paper and pen, buy a drink and get some work done on your own current project. If you don't have something on the go, Lauren will have some writing prompts and tools available for you to play around with - you never know, they might just inspire your next work of art!\n\nLook for a table of writerly types - we'll be the ones with laptops at a pub! - and come and say hi. Stay for the whole session, or pop in for as long as you can, but please RSVP so Lauren knows how many to book a table for. Contact her or Sutton Writers via meetup if you have any questions.",

Her latest collection, 'Two Hills,’ was inspired by her grandmother’s recollection of her home in Scotland.\n\nWe look forward to Sarah sharing her work, and her thoughts behind writing her poetry, with us.\n\n**********\n\nNEW MEMBERS ALWAYS WELCOME\n\nMembers: The full annual membership fee includes admission to our monthly meeting.

If you’re feeling this, and want to make progress, come along and sit among your fellow writers at this writing session hosted by Sutton Writers member Lauren McMenemy.\n\nThese sessions do exactly what they say on the tin: you sit, and you write. It's protected time for creativity, with the bonus of having others in the same boat alongside you. You won't be reading out any work - you can keep it totally to yourself - and there won't be any guest speakers. This is really just about getting words on a page.\n\nBring yourself, your laptop/paper and pen, buy a drink and get some work done on your own current project. If you don't have something on the go, Lauren will have some writing prompts and tools available for you to play around with - you never know, they might just inspire your next work of art!\n\nLook for a table of writerly types - we'll be the ones with laptops at a pub! - and come and say hi. Stay for the whole session, or pop in for as long as you can, but please RSVP so Lauren knows how many to book a table for. Contact her or Sutton Writers via meetup if you have any questions.\n\nHope to see you there!",

Visit rachelknightley.com or DM to ask questions/say hello!\n\n**Week 1: Goal-setting**\nSometimes a busy or stressful time means dealing with the ‘immediate’ in our lives constantly and the ‘important’ more rarely. This can mean what we want takes a back-seat to what we fear. Today is a chance to connect with each other, reconnect with ourselves and explore relaxing and intriguing coaching tools to focus on what you enjoy, love, value, and what steps can connect your wishes and hopes to your habits and goals for the work, art and life you want.\n**Week 2:** **Characterisation – in Life** **and Art!**\nWho are the characters that we carry in our minds, whose opinions, wishes and values affect our decision-making? Both in our fiction and day-to-day life, today is an opportunity to get to know those voices, ask what they want, and ask yourself whether you still want them as major or minor characters. Enjoy a mix of exercises to bring your own voice out of the chorus, and actively select which voices get to stay in your backing group!\n**Week 3: Plotting – The Story So Far**\nToday we explore the relationship between character and plot: how events create characters, but also how characters, as they change, change the world around them as a result. Enjoy a mix of practical exercises, story tools and problem-solving activities to make your story grow your way. These techniques will work for decisions on the page as well as those you make in work, at home and with family and friends.\n**Week 4:** **Time and Place**\nToday we’ll look at what it means to feel present in your life and story, and how that sense of being present allows you to experience and utilise your time. Make un-rushed, value-centred choices about what you do, how and who you spend your time with and what you give space to in life and on the page. Explore and develop incisive questions for your unique story, on the page and off it!\n**Week 5: Freedom Not Fear: Approaching the Blank Page**\nWhen you are clear about your character’s objective, it’s much easier to know what dialogue and actions they will select. This is just as true in life as it is on the page or on the stage. Today, we’ll be using tools, activities and resources to explore self-direction and value-aligned action. Bring “show don’t tell” into your boundaries in work and life, and into the quality of your creative and professional writing.\n**Week 6:** **Moving Forward**\nA celebration and summary of the discoveries you’ve made in art, work and life. Requests welcome for any favourite exercises to revisit, as we honour the journeys so far and plan for what happens next. Looking back to goal-setting in week 1, what are the things that were important to you then and how are you going to keep the ‘important’ above water when the ‘immediate’ is all around?\n\nBook weekly through Meetup or book the full course at www.greeninkwritersgym.com",

Developing on what you’ve learnt about them, today we ask what’s the worst thing that can happen to them, who they are (or want to be) and how do they grow by the events of the plot?\n**Week 4: Framing the Journey**: **Beginnings and Endings**\nThe more you know about your characters, plot and theme, the freer you will be to decide how you want to present your story to your reader. Should it be chronological? Or is there a later event that, if revealed earlier, will ensure we’re hooked? Explore different shapes and routes your story’s journey could take.\n**Week 5: Short and Long Form: A Moment or a Process**?\nToday we’ll explore the differences between short and long-form memoir and fiction. We’ll use techniques to identify the key moment of change around which you can shape a compelling narrative through use of pace and momentum.\n**Week 6: Live Editing**\nSelect an extract of your current work-in-progress to receive live editorial feedback.

The Eye of Argon by Jim Theis has gained a dubious reputation by being considered one of the worst fantasy works written. The challenge involves reading the Eye of Argon without laughing or hesitating, passing the book on to the next reader once you do.\n\nSo feel free to come along and we will be back to usual in January.\n\nJust to note that The Lamb has an upstairs so we will likely be there.

If you would like to come along and read the stories in advance just drop me a private message on Meetup with your email and I will send you the link.\n\nThis will be a physical meeting in the Duke, 7 Rodger Street. I have booked a table and we will likely be downstairs.\n\nLook forward to seeing you there.",

It surrounds issues of consent and thought it has so many issues arising in it that a good discussion might follow. It gives us a month to catch up on via various platforms, Apple TV being one of them and BBC Iplayer for those in the UK. Any thoughts / objections?\n\nIssues raised in I MAY DESTROY YOU include: Consent, Homosexuality, Casual Drug use, Alcohol, Victim Blaming? The list goes on!",
