        "description": "<p>***How to Write a Sci-Fi Screenplay! (July 9)***<br/>This free class provides an overview of how to write a sci-fi movie or TV pilot. **Bring your Sci-Fi ideas and loglines!** Whether you stick to the conventions or bend them, your ability to write a compelling sci-fi screenplay requires a deep foundational understanding of the style and structure of the genre. We’ll look at areas of interest in modern technological and societal trends, and practice extrapolating them into fascinating story seeds.</p> <p>* Brainstorm interesting questions related to technology in the news<br/>* Understand the foundations of three-act structure and Conor's process for writing a screenplay.<br/>* Learn science fiction story conventions and thematic tropes<br/>* Begin developing your premise and logline</p> <p>***About the Instructor:***<br/>**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young &amp; Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet.

We will dive into how to develop a compelling sci-fi story world with a killer premise that meets genre expectations.</p> <p>**Bring your Sci-Fi ideas and loglines!** You will workshop your concepts during this bootcamp, as you move from idea to outline, through lessons on screenwriting craft, character, conflict, world-building, and the components of speculative fiction, futurist storytelling and sci-fi sub-genres.</p> <p>By the end of the 4-week bootcamp, you will have completed a detailed outline, and you'll be ready to begin writing your sci-fi feature screenplay or TV pilot.</p> <p>*This course is ideal for:*</p> <p>* **beginning screenwriters** who would like to understand the core concepts of sci-fi screenwriting and how to move their project forward.<br/>* **experienced screenwriters** who want to participate in a more formal setting with the guidance of an experienced sci-fi writer.<br/>*</p> <p>***Sci-Fi Bootcamp Course Schedule***<br/>**Week 1: What If…? (July 16)**<br/>During this week's intensive two-hour workshop, you will gain a deeper understanding of the categories and styles of Science Fiction (hard versus soft science, utopian, dystopian, science-fantasy and others) and the quirks of writing this genre for film and television. We will continue to develop your speculative science-related questions into sharp dramatic arguments, carried by unforgettable characters. Your finalized logline will help you begin to transmute this world from your imagination to the page.</p> <p>* Finalize your logline<br/>* Begin filling out your sketchbook</p> <p>**Week 2: Building the World (July 23)**<br/>Now that you've nailed down your movie or TV pilot idea, it's time to build a complex science fiction story world imbued with humanity and imagination. In this genre, our storytelling choices are often limited by (and also inspired by!) the limitations of technical logistics. How might we design a functioning colony on a distant planet? What interesting stories result from different social class systems? Most importantly, we will focus on delivering the full potential of these ideas without leaning too hard on information dumps and clumsy exposition.</p> <p>* Develop your protagonist and antagonist<br/>* Flesh out your sci-fi story world and its rules</p> <p>**Week 3: Blockbuster Moments (July 30)**<br/>This week, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your science fiction story. Chiefly: how to identify your character arcs, structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them. You’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to deliver on the promise of your sci-fi premise.</p> <p>* Come up with a **\"Blockbuster Moment\"** \\- one awesome moment from the middle of the movie or pilot that will leave the audience breathless or cheering\\.<br/>* Complete your Story Beats outline</p> <p>**Week 4: Genre &amp; Structure (August 6)**<br/>Time to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your sci-fi movie or pilot as a **“scene card,**” which is a synopsis for every key moment in your story. ScriptCamp heavily emphasizes this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive page-by-page roadmap through your entire screenplay.</p> <p>* Manage the genre expectations and tone of your story.<br/>* Complete your scene cards<br/>* Write you opening scene<br/>* Ready to start writing pages by Aug 13!</p> ",

Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.</p> <p>**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**<br/>Time to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.</p> <p>**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**<br/>It’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.</p> <p>**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**<br/>You’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.</p> <p>**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**<br/>This class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.</p> <p>**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**<br/>Many newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.</p> <p>**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**<br/>In our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly every Sunday. Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.</p> <p>**Week 6: Endings (Aug 7)**<br/>Time to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!</p> <p>***About the Instructor:***<br/>**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young &amp; Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp</a>), [YouTube](<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos</a>) and [Twitch](<a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp</a>)</p> <p>**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**<br/>• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [<a href=\"https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/\" class=\"linkified\">https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/</a>)<br/>• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [<a href=\"https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\" class=\"linkified\">https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/</a>)</p> <p>***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***<br/>**Week 1: Loglines &amp; Sketchbook (July 3)**<br/>We begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.</p> <p>**Week 2: Story Beats (July 10)**<br/>Now that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.</p> <p>**Week 3: Scene Cards (July 17)**<br/>Time to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.</p> <p>**Week 4: Beginnings (July 24)**<br/>Now is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.</p> <p>**Week 5: Second Act (July 31)**<br/>You’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.</p> <p>**Week 6: Endings (Aug 7)**<br/>Time to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!</p> ",

        "description": "<p>The eight-week Bootcamp runs June 24 through August 12. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a[masked] page script.</p> <p>The intention behind this bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.</p> <p>**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**<br/>In our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!</p> <p>***About the Instructor:***<br/>**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young &amp; Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.

Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. During this class, you’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the process of filling out your sketchbook.</p> <p>**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (July 1)**<br/>Now that you’ve filled out your sketchbook, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.</p> <p>**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**<br/>Time to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.</p> <p>**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**<br/>It’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.</p> <p>**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**<br/>You’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.</p> <p>**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**<br/>This class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.</p> <p>**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**<br/>Many newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.</p> <p>**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**<br/>In our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!</p> ",

        "description": "<p>During this two-hour interactive class with pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, we’ll watch examples and look at what makes short storytelling work in a variety of genres. By ensuring that we understand the promises of our genre, we can brainstorm efficient ways to deliver the expected thrills within even a miniscule runtime. We will look at the basics of short film structure and how to write a polished short screenplay within four weeks.</p> <p>The complete four-week **Short Screenplay Bootcamp** course focuses on clear, concise storytelling within the framework of a 1-10 page film script. Whether it’s a comedy sketch or dramatic vignette, you’ll study and explore short-form storytelling, then plan, draft, and revise a complete script by the end of the four-week course. Perfect for filmmakers seeking a project to shoot, or aspiring writers looking to start a collaboration with a director.</p> <p>#### ***About the Instructor:***</p> <p>**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder’s Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young &amp; Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet.
