        "description": "My friend Helen is running a free online Yoga Session to release the stress from 2021 into a relaxed 2022\n\nHow does yoga help with stress?\nYour mobile phone is ringing. Your boss wants to talk to you. And your partner wants to know what's for dinner. Stress and anxiety are everywhere. If they're getting the best of you, you might want to hit the mat and give yoga a try.\n\nYoga is a mind-body practice that combines physical poses, controlled breathing, and meditation or relaxation. Yoga may help reduce stress, lower blood pressure and lower your heart rate. And anyone can do it.\n\nYoga encourages mental and physical relaxation, which helps reduce stress and anxiety. The physical postures promote flexibility, relieve tension, and alleviate pain. Yoga poses may help you release physical blockages like muscle knots, helping release emotions and tension.\n\nJoin me for a relaxing FREE online class and experience for yourself the power of yoga. All you need is a space to move about in and something to stand on ( preferably a non-slip mat).\nNOTES:\nDon't have more than a couple of biscuits and a (non-alcoholic) drink for one hour before we start (otherwise you may feel sick when we start stretching and bending!)\nWear comfortable clothes.\nHave a block, cushion or some books for support.\nHave socks, jumpers and/or blankets for the relaxation (body temperature drops when you are lying still).",

Service is towards the end the performance (approx 1 hour after your start time). All dietary requirements will be catered for if notified 24 hrs in advance.\n\nBohemians, you have been invited to the spectacular of the century, the Mulan Rouge! It's time to leave your gender at the door, adorn your finest armour and pack your glitter purse - or risk bringing dishonour to us all.\nThis year, the heart of The Vaults has been transformed into the infamous Mulan Rouge, a scandalous haven of dancing and naughty delights.\nThe Vaults, with ShayShay, have taken the wonderful worlds of Disney’s Mulan and Baz Luhrmann’s Moulin Rouge and crashed together a drag-tastic parody - fusing comedy, burlesque and a feast to boot. This is a cabaret of fabulous kings and queens, set to take you on Mulan’s journey of self discovery; and where better to make that discovery than the Mulan Rouge!\nAcross the lands, a terrifying whisper is taking hold: The Huns are preparing to attack! Mulan disguises themself as a man to join the war effort, but when their regiment commandeers the glittering Mulan Rouge, they find themself surrounded by glitz, glamour and go-go girls. Come what may, Mulan’s identity must be kept secret to defeat The Huns and defend the honour of the Mulan Rouge. Though when they meet a girl worth fighting for, will the whole plan go up in smoke?\nSo grab all your soul sistas (lemme hear y’all flow sistas) and descend below the flames of Paris for a burning hot, drag-tastic soiree. Down here, diamonds really are a queen’s best friend.\nWith a feast and cocktails fit for the green fairy, we can promise you a night of spectacular as mysterious as the dark side of the moon. So let's get down to busy-ness!\nDoors 6:30pm Venue recommend arriving at 7:00pm Show starts promptly at 7:15pm\nSuitable for Ages 18+. Sexually explicit and strong language.

The two brothers drew more than two million people of all ages across the biggest arenas in Germany. They are the only magicians worldwide who sold out a football stadium with 40,000 people, gaining them two world records. The Ehrlich Brothers’ show features mind-blowing spectacular illusions, close-up magic right in the middle of the audience, enchanting and surprising for the whole family. Now they set out for their first UK dates with their brand-new show DREAM & FLY. An irresistible breathtaking experience taking magic to new dimensions.  What was formerly a rabbit jumping out of a hat, today, is a heavy-weighted Harley blasting out of an oversized iPad. With their sensational shows Andreas and Chris Ehrlich, are taking magic into a new era and creating a fervor across the generations. Their overwhelming success story in Germany is rapidly spreading to many foreign countries. For their accomplishments in the art of magic, Andreas und Chris Ehrlich were appointed members of honor in the “Magic Circle“ of Great Britain– a recognition shared with distinguished magicians like David Copperfield and Siegfried and Roy.  From appearing in a helicopter ﬂying in mid-air, sculpting a golden Lamborghini from ﬂames to producing the world‘s largest candy jar, bulging with thousands of sweets – this show is something that has to be seen to be believed.  DREAM & FLY is being performed at the OVO Arena Wembley for the ﬁrst time ever in English. It is perfect for the entire family and will enchant imaginations bringing to life the kid inside every one of us.  With the Ehrlich Brothers, illusions become reality. Using a perfect mixture of elaborate illusions, sleight of hand, energy and charm, the Brothers’ performances dissolve easily onto an audience of 6 to 99.\nDoors open at 6.30pm & Event starts at 7.30pm",

We are intending to drive from and back to Glasgow - Ben Nevis - so would be great if we could take the same/similar flights.\n\nEveryone welcome! (Skyscanner was useful)\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/6/1/3/600_441334323.jpeg\n\nUPDATE -\n\nTeam Ben Nevis. Details below.....\n\nTo reassure - we will take the easy route up.....so it will be like a walk rather than a climb.\n\nDates - Friday 18th - Sunday 20th September\n\nTotal cost - c£180 including flights and accommodation\n\nCosts: Accommodation (Glen Nevis Youth Hostel) £40 pp for 2 nights - I have booked this already\n\nFlight - Book your own return on Skyscanner to Glasgow - suggestion £93 return attached\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/9/d/9/600_441103481.jpeg\n\nMeal - Ben Nevis pub recommended -\n\nTransport from airport - I will bookCar Hire - likely £30 pp max\n\nLet me know any more qus and let me know who is in....(limited availability due to accommodation booking)\n\nBest wishes,\nJane, Isabelle and Lucy\n\n1st details on this\n\nHi!\n\nThis is Jane - one of the founders - writing on all our behalf.\n\nIsabelle and I started to spend more time together in 2014, discussing divorce among other things....(before we had the great good fortune to meet Lucy).\n\nOne of the first things we did was to climb Mount Snowdon (here we are, at the top, in September 2014). We went there just the two of us and ended up climbing the mountain with a man called Ed who had brought along his daughter and her new boyfriend. It was brilliant - and pretty stress-relieving...not least because it is so beautiful there.\n\nWe loved it so much that we are planning to walk Ben Nevis in September and would love it if anyone who is keen would be up for joining us. The info is below - and just shout if you have any questions. We can give more info on Thursday at the Meet-up - and on Friday we will ensure it is posted here for those who can't make it on Thursday.\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/f/9/e/600_440463998.jpeg\n\nWeekend of 18th-20th September 2015\n\n(no of nights away likely 1 - Saturday 19th September - we will likely organise transport and accommodation - will keep you posted on costs)\n\nMore information about Ben Nevis can be found here:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1eksyPB\n\nDetails TBC - do let us know if you'd be interested in joining us.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nLucy, Isabelle and Jane",

There are plenty of dating clubs out there for those of you that are ready - and good luck!)\n\nSee you all soon!\n\nLucy, Isabelle and Jane",

        "description": "Hello! Sorry we're a bit later this month - we're meeting up on 18th October.\n\nI know some of you have had busy divorce months, so do come along for a drink, some snacks and we can swop notes/ advice. Hope you are all well and really looking forward to seeing you all.\n\nTo new members: we are a group that meet informally for drinks and chat. It's really helpful when you're going through a divorce to talk to others in the same boat. We're not a therapy group, just a bunch of people who know what it's like - although some people find our meets very therapeutic! But contrary to expectations, we usually have a laugh and a joke. Please come along and feel free to message me here or at lucy@divorceclub.com if you want to talk to me before coming along.\n\nCheers, Lucy",

Also, you don't have to drink beer as there are plenty of other options.\nWhat is nice about this bar is that if you don't like darts, you get your own area so it is easy to talk.\nIf you are no good at darts, I promise you will be better than me so don't worry about that either!",

Divorce Club have lined up an event to help you blow out those cobwebs and start the year as you mean to go on - positive, full of great goals for the New Year, ready to meet new friends and form new relationships, start new (or previously loved but long untended) hobbies and have a fun night out.\n\nThe evening is upstairs at the Rugby Tavern and there will be plenty of opportunities to meet people and have a chat in an informal way, but also if you are a bit shy, there are also plenty of things to do that will help break the ice.\n\nWould you like this new Year to be a squillion times better than this one? Do you want to set new goals or try something new? Would you like to try a new hobby or find a rewarding way to use your time?\n\nTake the chance to set goals for the new year. Not just punitive NY resolutions but goals that you actually look forward to acting on! You can also join the hobby/ volunteering challenge. Anyone who commits to trying out a new hobby can be part of our special group set up on the night to gee each other up for moral support. Get pointers on where to start. Get a deadline to help with motivation! Don’t even know what to try? Take a chance on our Try Something New tombola!\n\nAre you ready to meet new people or start a relationship but confused by the new online websites and apps?\n\nRelationship Coach Rachel New will have advice and individual help for people who need help with profiles, pics, messaging and etiquette. Rachel has run several fantastic workshops which are jam packed with advice and useful tips to help navigate what can be an enormously fun way to spend your time.\n\nCould you do with looking after yourself a bit more? Finding a more sustainable way of living/ managing stress?\n\nClinical Psychologist, Isabelle Hung, will help you feel just a little bit more fantastic than you did when you walked in… She will help you think about your well being issues whether they be work/life balance, stress management, or simply looking after yourself. Come to our well being corner and feel a bit more human as a result. We’ve got your back…\n\nCome and get some advice, support and exercises to help you in the darker moments. And remember, just the act of getting out and meeting people can be the best tonic you can have. Don't worry if you don't know anyone - just email admin@divorceclub.com in advance and we will know to look out for you, or tell us you need some help with introductions when you arrive. We work hard to make sure everyone is put at their ease.\n\nThe nights are long and black, but we don't have to be - come and enjoy an event to put a New Year spring in your step!\n\nThere will be prizes, ice breakers, and no-one leaves empty handed. Hope to see you all there.\n\nLucy, Isabelle and Rachel\n\nBuy tickets at the special earlybird price of £11. (We are still running free events during the year - the next one will be in March)",

Daunting as this may seem, most people end up being more confident than before!**\n\nGetting your confidence back will be a gradual process and requires effort. The basic psychology is that we want to avoid things we aren’t familiar with. To get confident, you have to feel the fear and anxiety of new actions, embrace it, and move ahead and do them anyway.\n\nIn this session Dr Isabelle Hung shares research on ways you can make your confidence grow again including the basic steps to getting there.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n**To access this event:**\nThis event and many others are included free for Divorce Club members.

        "description": "**Going through a separation or divorce can be a hugely stressful experience. It can affect us mentally, physically, and emotionally. Over a prolonged period of time, stress can reduce your happiness and leave your quality of life hanging in the balance. The best way to combat these mental, physical and emotional feelings is to take active steps to prevent and manage stress.**\n\nPaula Ruane is a therapist who deals with trauma and resilience. A school of thought is that the body holds trauma, it is physically affected by stress, and therefore talking is not enough, one also needs to address the physical symptoms that are created by stress.\n\nAs one of the UK’s leading stress specialists, Paula has developed effective, unique, and proven stress prevention resilience training programmes for individuals and organisations.\n\nAt this event you will learn techniques designed to offer a holistic approach to healing:\n\n* How to reduce stress\n* How to return calm in your life\n* How to achieve focus and clarity\n* How to improve your mental and emotional health\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\n**To access this event:**\nThis event and many others are included free for Divorce Club members.

Bargello can be used on normal fabric-like needlepoint fabric but we're using plastic canvas so that you can turn your Bargello design into a coaster! Or you can sew them up to create a pencil holder, plant pot, tissue box cover even.\n\nLevel:\nBeginners\n\nDuration:\n2 hours\n\nDo I Need to Bring Anything:\nDuring the lesson you'll start two coasters and receive plenty of wool to finish your creations. You will take home a kit consisting of a total of 4 canvas and the wool and needle you need to complete your coasters.\n\nAll our workshops include unlimited tea, coffee and we always have plenty of cake on offer at every workshop and vegan friendly biscuits.

From the west to east, the seven hills are individually named and occasionally used in filmmaking and TV productions. To get there, we are going to take a bus from Eastbourne to the amazing Seven Sisters Country Park.\n\nEntering into the park, we will walk to the beach along the access trail and enjoy the great views from the top of the cliffs (3 miles walk about 1,30 to 2 hours walk). Please pack your lunch as we will do a 30 min stop to eat along the way.\n\nGetting there: Trains from London Victoria to Eastbourne around 1.30h\n\nTrain standard ticket price: around £36.30 any time return.

Brunch in a stylish healthy eating joint with plenty “free-from” options.\n\n“If Jay Gatsby had fled West Egg for the beaches of Bali, his new home would probably look a lot like west London’s latest health food spot. Farmacy (as in health from the farm, geddit?) is free from most things – dairy, refined sugars, meat, additives and chemical nasties – though happily, not taste. In fact, it’s packed with all kinds of taste, from the food coming out of the kitchen to the ultra-sleek décor. Despite being a vegan-friendly restaurant there is a reassuring lack of hemp, and pretty bamboo is tempered with beautiful brushed gold. It’s smart, to be sure, but the atmosphere is relaxed and the staff are really friendly and, more importantly, not at all stuck-up.”\n\nCheck the menu here: https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0075/5931/5554/files/Brunch_menu_August_2019.pdf?9345\n\nClosest tube station: Nothing Hill (Central/District Line)\n\nSee you there!

        "description": "Otherworld is an all-new immersive virtual reality arcade & bar in East London\n\nWhen you enter the arcade itself – it’s in an old railway arch which they’ve transformed with neon-soaked, cyberpunk details, and filled with cool-looking cylindrical chambers. These are called the ‘immersion rooms’, and we each get our own one. Don’t worry though, you’ll all still be able to hear each other.\n\nInside they’re rigged with multi-sensory widgets that’ll make everything that little bit more immersive, meaning you’ll be able to “feel the sun beat down on your face as you emerge from the cave, feel the wind in your hair as you slide down a vast mountain and feel the thud beneath your feet of a new land to explore.”\n\nThere are 16 games to pick from in total, meaning you can “paint in 3D with light and fire”; dance with lightsabers; climb a full-scale Everest; “stride the earth like a giant” in Google Earth VR; blow up robots with laser cannons in Space Pirate Trainer; fight zombie hordes in Arizona Sunshine; and play a surreal game called Accounting Plus which they apparently “can’t explain”.\n\nAfter the games, we’ll be able to decompress in the Otherworld bar/restaurant, which has 360 degree art projections animating your surroundings, and a self-serve beer tap pouring house-brew lager. The food all comes from Lords of Poké (and includes poke bowls, Hawaiian pulled-pork tacos, teriyaki sliders, etc.) and the cocktails have all been designed by an ex-Milk & Honey mixologist. And then?\n\nIt’s back to reality.\n\nPlease book here for Saturday, 5 October at 12:30 PM for 55 minutes (ticket price is £35 but very worth it as this is an experience you can't find anywhere else!!): https://www.other.world/booking/new/4\n\nWebsite: https://www.other.world\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/otherworld.london/",

        "description": "Hey everyone!\n\nTime to grab brunch in one of the most vibrant markets in London, Old Spitafields Market.\n\n“Proudly independent, this all-day brasserie is a dependable alternative to Spitalfields’ pervasive chains – not surprising since it’s co-owned by bright spark Clive Watson (of The Garrison and Village East fame). Fans praise Blixen’s “well-done and good-value” food, as well as its spot-on service and buzzy vibe – whether you’re in the light, airy dining room or the rustic wood-toned basement bar. One regular also likes the ‘secret garden’ for a quick lunch. The cooking is broadly European, moving from pea and wild garlic soup or scallop crudo with radish and poppy seeds to robust mains of corn-fed chicken with roasted Jerusalem artichoke and chicken jus or pork belly with spätzle, kale and quince. To round things off, we like the sound of the banana and caramel pudding with coconut sorbet. Brunch, daytime snacks and Sunday roasts lure the crowds, while drinks encompass house sodas, smoothies, locally brewed beers and some “OK” wines.”\n\nThe table is booked for 6 people from 13 pm and I’ll be there just before. If you can’t attend, please make sure to cancel 24-48 hours in advance to allow other to attend.\n\nCheck the brunch menu on their website: http://blixen.co.uk\n\nClosest tube station: Aldgate East Station (District Line) or Liverpool Station (Central Line)\n\nLooking forward to see you there!

The tickets are actually £25 per person, which is a lot of money for a scavenger hunt even if it is worth it, so I decided to book for less people but have more players. If we have enough we can split into two teams to make it even more competitive. I think the only issue would be with the prizes at the end, which was the only let down tbh so I doubt anyone would be too upset to go without…or we could share ;)",

The only difference is that we will experiment with playing some of the tunes using different rhythms and tempos (such as afrocuban and samba). In these cases I will support the drum kit player with congas and the clave. Exploring latin jazz and experimenting with different rhythms will ensure we don't get bored practicing the same tunes again !. We will also practice improving on the introductions and conclusions for each tune.\n\nAs before - we will have 4 hours of practice time from 7pm-11pm. Attendees will be split into two groups, Group 1 practicing from 7pm-9 and Group 2 from 9pm-11pm. In the studio there is a piano, drum kit, base and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones. When you arrive at the site it will look like you're going into a restaurant - don't be confused by this, just go through and ask to be directed to Studio no. 2.\n\nHere are the tunes to practice for the 2nd session. For each tune, you'll find a sample improv/suggestion for intended tempo and rhythm in addition to a sample backing track:\n\n1) Blue Bossa (C minor Concert Key). To be practiced Afrocuban style:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRN88c-9GtY (sample improv)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDvTebiIhc (sample backing track)\n\n2) Autumn Leaves (in G minor Concert Key) . To be practiced as a Samba:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVJAc3nxhqY (sample improv)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0eOJxnB3Ok (sample backing track but in swing as I could not find one in a samba)\n\n3) My One & Only Love (in key of Concert C). To be practiced as a Ballad.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5XJhl18oxM (sample backing track)\n\n4) Beautiful Love (Concert Key D minor). To be practiced as a fast Swing:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccqW1xHKZA4 (sample backing track)\n\nI created this dropbox location for you to access the sheet music in the correct ConcertKeys: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0kyh9krngmu3tez/AACu9VPAYpVVxn6hTipdTXvAa?dl=0 ­\n\nAlternatively you can use this resource: https://www.swiss-jazz.ch/partitions-real-book.htm\n\nPls let me know if you need any help/have any questions related to this event.\n\nThere is a contribution of £6 pounds to cover the cost of hiring the studio with equipment.\n\nthank you & hope to see you there !\n\nhanan xx\n\nOrganiser (Beginners' Jazz Improv Sessions)",

        "description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nFor our third session I thought to move away from the tunes practiced for previous sessions. Even though we have not perfected those previous tunes yet, I think it’s good to take a break from the old and to experiment with funkier more up beat and non-traditional jazz tunes. Please however don’t completely forget the older tunes – as the aim is to eventually get back to them and to improve our performance of everything we practice.\n\nAs before - we will have 4 hours of practice time from 2:30pm to 6:30pm. Attendees will be split into two groups, Group 1 practicing from 2:30-4:30pm and Group 2 from 4:30-6:30pm. When you RSVP, please state your instrument and whether you have a preference for a slot and I will do my best to place you according to your preference. If you have paid via paypal and it turns out you can only attend the slot of your choice and I am unable to place you according to your preference – I will of course refund you right away.\n\nIn the studio there is a piano, drum kit, base and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones. When you arrive at the site it will look like you're going into a restaurant - don't be confused by this, just go through and ask to be directed to Studio no. 2.\n\nHere are the tunes to practice for the 3rd session. The first two are by one of the biggest names in latin and funky jazz Paquito D’Rivera, and the third tune one is by the great jazz composer Dave Brubeck. As these are all instrumental, singers are invited to scat over them. If there is time, we could try to create/improvise an additional fourth tune together at the end or play one of our previous tunes.\n\n1) Chucho (minor blues – mambo)\n\noriginal recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtyvJvsmaMg\n\nSmall band performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfX7fXbF894\n\nBacking track for your practice: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s9yh3g079nd54rs/Chucho%20%28Minor%20Blues%29_Backingtrack.m4a?dl=0\n\n2) Gdansk (latin Jazz funk):\n\nOriginal recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdtEwVDPsc\n\nSmall band performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHsI30pa204\n\nBacking track for your practice: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gu5ojjvlcw3knfm/Gdansk_BackingTrack.m4a?dl=0\n\n3) Take Five: Eb minor, 5/4 quintuple time\n\noriginal recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHdU5sHigYQ\n\nbacking track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2KuJCZuEso\n\nI created this dropbox location for you to access the sheet music in the appropriate key.

        "description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nThe group vote indicated Tuesday as the most preferred day for most. However as I will be travelling next Tuesday, the next session it will be a Saturday. For subsequent sessions I aim to organise the practice for Tuesdays every two weeks.\n\nFor this coming fourth session let's continue to work on the same tunes as the last time in order to perfect them. I'm just adding a review of \"Beautiful Love\" to the list (we attempted this tune on the first two practice sessions).\n\nAs before - we will have 4 hours of practice time from 2:30pm to 6:30pm. Attendees will be split into two groups, Group 1 practicing from 2:30-4:30pm and Group 2 from 4:30-6:30pm. When you RSVP, please state your instrument and whether you have a preference for a slot and I will do my best to place you according to your preference. If you have paid via paypal and it turns out you can only attend the slot of your choice and I am unable to place you according to your preference – I will of course refund you right away.\n\nIn the studio there is a piano, drum kit, base and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones. When you arrive at the site it will look like you're going into a restaurant - don't be confused by this, just go through and ask to be directed to Studio no. 7 on the ground floor.\n\nHere are the tunes to practice for the 4th session.\n\n1) Chucho (minor blues – mambo)\n\noriginal recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtyvJvsmaMg\n\nSmall band performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfX7fXbF894\n\nBacking track for your practice: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s9yh3g079nd54rs/Chucho%20%28Minor%20Blues%29_Backingtrack.m4a?dl=0\n\n2) Gdansk (latin Jazz funk):\n\nOriginal recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdtEwVDPsc\n\nSmall band performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHsI30pa204\n\nBacking track for your practice: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gu5ojjvlcw3knfm/Gdansk_BackingTrack.m4a?dl=0\n\n3) Take Five: Eb minor, 5/4 quintuple time\n\noriginal recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHdU5sHigYQ\n\nbacking track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2KuJCZuEso\n\n4) Beautiful Love (Concert Key D minor).

I've therefore had to increase the contribution to £10 to ensure this does not happen - this contribution would allow us to continue going forward, and hopefully it's not too much to ask :\n\nthank you & hope to see you there !\n\nhanan xx\n\nOrganiser (Beginners' Jazz Improv Sessions)",

        "description": "Hi Everyone\n\nHappy New Year ! and finally getting ready for our next practice/jam session.\n\nFor first timers: this group's meetups are designed as jazz jam/practice sessions in professional rehearsal studios without an audience. We are all beginners and amateur musicians seeking a safe/supportive space to practice with others. We simply agree ahead of time to practice some tunes, then we get to gether and practice playing them together and learn from each other in the process. The idea is to provide a encouraging/professional space for all of us to play music together, and to improve with time till we are confident enough to perform in public.\n\nAs in previous meetups, in this event we will have 4 hours of practice/jam time from 7pm to 11pm. Attendees will be split into two groups, Group 1 practicing from 7-9pm and Group 2 from 9-11pm. When you RSVP, please state your instrument and whether you have a preference for a time slot and I will do my best to place you according to your preference. In the studio there will be a piano, drum kit, base and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones. A contribution of £8.50 made by each participant is to cover the cost of hiring the studio along with all the professional equipment in it and none of it goes in my pocket as the organisation is an entirely voluntary activity on my part.\n\nHere are the tunes to prepare for the coming session. The list is a good combo of different styles/genres of jazz, all feasible for beginners, and fun to play.

        "description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIn the 7th session we will continue practicing/perfecting the same tunes as in session 6. As always we will have 4 hours of practice/jam time from 7pm to 11pm. Attendees will be split into two groups, Group 1 practicing from 7-9pm and Group 2 from 9-11pm. When you RSVP, please state your instrument and whether you have a preference for a slot and I will do my best to place you according to your preference. In the studio there is a piano, drum kit, base and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones. A contribution of £8.50 made by each participant is to cover the cost of hiring the studio along with all the professional equipment in it and none goes to the organiser as it is an entirely voluntary meetup group.\n\nHere are the tunes to review/perfect. The list is a good combo of different styles/genres of jazz, all feasible for beginners, and fun to play. All of the tunes also have lyrics for singers apart from ‘Gdansk’ - so singers please join us !\n\n1) Blue bossa by Kenny Dorham (Bossanova in C minor concert key): One example rendition of the tune as a bossa:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be9sYE0BTB8\n\n• Bossa backing track for your practice (150bpm):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H7Xg6U7P5g\n\n• If you’re feeling brave check out this afrocuban style rendition:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D-7IdWYndE\n\n• You can also practice it in afrocuban style with this backing track:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDvTebiIhc\n\n• Sheet music and lyrics: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2nc0kkj3xxxxjws/AAB_rcCgx_twoF4rNvVf_xhva?dl=0\n\nIt would be awesome if we can perfect playing Blue Bossa both as a bossa and as a afrocuban salsa\n\n2.

        "description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIn the 8th session we will concentrate on fewer tunes. We will have 4 hours of practice/jam time from 10am to 2pm. Attendees will be split into two groups, Group 1 practicing from 10am-12pm and Group 2 from 12pm-2pm. When you RSVP, please state your instrument and whether you have a preference for a slot and I will do my best to place you according to your preference. In the studio there is a piano, drum kit, base and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones. A contribution of £8.50 made by each participant is to cover the cost of hiring the studio along with all the professional equipment in it and none goes to the organiser as it is an entirely voluntary meetup group.\n\nHere are the tunes to review/perfect. The list is a good combo of different styles/genres of jazz, all feasible for beginners, and fun to play. All of the tunes also have lyrics for singers apart from ‘Gdansk’ - so singers please join us !\n\n1) Blue bossa by Kenny Dorham (Bossanova in C minor concert key): One example rendition of the tune as a bossa:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be9sYE0BTB8\n\n• Bossa backing track for your practice (150bpm):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H7Xg6U7P5g\n\n• If you’re feeling brave check out this afrocuban style rendition:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D-7IdWYndE\n\n• You can also practice it in afrocuban style with this backing track:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeDvTebiIhc\n\n• Sheet music and lyrics: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2nc0kkj3xxxxjws/AAB_rcCgx_twoF4rNvVf_xhva?dl=0\n\nIt would be awesome if we can perfect playing Blue Bossa both as a bossa and as a afrocuban salsa\n\n2. Autumn Leaves by Joseph Kosma (Medium Swing in G minor Concert Key):\n\n• One beautiful rendition as a swing:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c3a1VL9894\n\n• Medium Swing backing track for your practice (150bpm):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0eOJxnB3Ok\n\n• Here’s another beautiful rendition of the tune but as funk soul:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXw6MtwhwDc\n\nmaybe we could try this tune as both a medium swing and as a funky soul tune?\n\n• Sheet music and lyrics: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0h3il9qazzaevqn/AAAeXnu-IQHiS70xFtSUs3Gja?dl=0\n\n3. Gdansk by Paquito Rivera (Funky Latin tune in D minor concert key):\n\n• Original Rendition:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdtEwVDPsc\n\n• Backing track for your practice: https://www.dropbox.com/s/gu5ojjvlcw3knfm/Gdansk_BackingTrack.m4a?dl=0\n\n• Example of small band performing:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHsI30pa204\n\n• Sheet music: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cnfeqz1g3wztnkw/AADzFeli3GO7oy0Z5vAoM2XZa?dl=0\n\n4.

        "description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIn the 9th session we will experiment for the first time with recording some of the tunes we've been rehearsing together. It will be the same set as the last time (I'm listing the set again below). The recording will be amateurish using a handheld camera with mic so please come prepared as much as you can. Our main challenges to date has been learning to play in tune and in time as a group and coordinating/agreeing on: (1) how to begin a tune, (2) how to improvise within it and (3) how to end it in a synchronised uninterrupted fashion. In my previous email I shared some notes/suggestions for overcoming these challenges for the tunes concerned. If you intend to attend this meetup - please refer to that last email. Alternatively, you can access the suggested practice notes again here : https://www.dropbox.com/s/15uq49xwm3dxi9r/PracticeNotes_1.docx?dl=0\n\nHere is a reminder of the tunes to prepare:\n1) Blue Bossa (in Concert C minor)\n2) Autumn Leaves (in Concert G minor)\n3) Work Song (In Concert F Minor)\n4) Gdansk (in Concert D Minor)\n\nYou can access the relevant sheet music (available for all instruments) in this location:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/home/BeginnersJamSessions\n\nAs usual will have 4 hours of practice/jam time from 7pm to 11pm. If more than 6 people sign up to the event, registrants will be split into two groups. Group 1 practicing from 7pm-9pm and Group 2 from 9pm-11pm. When you RSVP, please state your instrument and whether you have a preference for a slot and I will do my best to place you according to your preference. If only a small number sign up you are welcome to attend one or both sessions to maximise benefit from practice time.\n\nIn the studio there is a piano, drum kit, base and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones.

        "description": "Hi everyone,\n\nThis event is a hands-on 2 hour educational session lead by Adam Dyer, a professional jazz musician. Takes place Studio 3, The Premises, Sat 2nd June promptly at 2:30pm. It will be the first event of this type where we invite a professional musician to be our guide.\n\nUsing the same tunes we've been playing, Adam will provide us tips on areas such as improvisation, accompaniment and rhythm - so that we can sound more cohesive together and closer to a performing standard.\n\n***A short bio on our teacher***:\nAdam Dyer is a graduate of the Guildhall School of Music, and a professional jazz pianist and teacher. He has performed with well known jazz musicians such as Bobby Wellins (at the London Jazz Festival), Dan Berglund and Gregory Porter (at the Stockholm Jazz Festival), and is a regular at Ronnie Scott's. He has also played jazz/classical crossover projects with the likes of the Southbank Sinfonia and has featured live in concert with the Guildhall Big Band on BBC Radio 3.\n\nThis is a great opportunity for anyone looking to learn and places are limited to max 10 participants to enable smooth running of the workshop - so please sign up soon if interested. **(Please note however that we can only take one player for each of these instruments: base, piano, drums, electric guitar. If multiple sign up, the additional players will be refunded immediately)** The studio will have a piano, a drum kit, 1 guitar amp & 1 base amp, enough mics, stands and chairs for all.\n\nThe higher than usual price goes to paying for the studio & equipment hire along with the teacher's fee.\n\nBelow I list the tunes along with sample backings tracks once more so you can practice ahead of time:\n\n1) Blue Bossa (in Concert C minor)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H7Xg6U7P5g\n2) Autumn Leaves (in Concert G minor)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0eOJxnB3Ok\n3) Work Song (In Concert F Minor)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=or0IlXTmFiY\n4) Gdansk (in Concert D Minor)\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gu5ojjvlcw3knfm/Gdansk_BackingTrack.m4a?dl=0\n5) How high the moon (in Concert G major)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxtLS4t9jP0\n\nAll relevant sheet music for these tunes (for all instruments) accessible in this location:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/0kyh9krngmu3tez/AACu9VPAYpVVxn6hTipdTXvAa?dl=0\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nHanan & Zee\nCo-organisers of Beginners Jazz Jam",

You can find more details here - http://www.hideawaylive.co.uk/jazz-workshops\n\nIn addition, those who wish can also play in the jam afterwards - so we may have a chance of performing this song to an audience, for many of us perhaps for the first time!\n\nTo prepare for the jam session, there will also be a practice session (at the usual venue, the Premises) the day before on June 17th so that we can get a good amount of practice.\n\nNote that the Hideaway charges £10 for the workshop, but playing at the jam is free. The workshop begins promptly at 7.30pm and the jam at 9.30pm.\n\nHope to see many of you there!\nWith love,\n\nHanan and Xie",

We will have two groups of people rehearsing. You will be allocated to either the 10am group or the 12pm group and practice with us for two hours. To avoid confusion allocation will from now on be left to the discretion of the organisers who will assess total number of people & instruments registered, ensure there is a good balance of instruments in each group, and announce the allocations nearer the date.\n\nThese are the tunes we're trying in the next session:\n\n1). Autumn Leaves in a different key (this time will try playing this one in Concert A minor ), and maybe we could attempt it as a samba ?\n\n2). Midnight Mambo - this is a great latin tune by oscar hernandez , awesome beat with only 3 key chords so should make improvising fun and hopefully easy ! You can find the score for concert C instruments in this dropbox location: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yr70qxkc71znxg9/AACnP_x-HdU7xEdm8C3pnFvna?dl=0\nOther instruments would need to transpose or learn by ear from the recording. One good version of it is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmR19DJ-fVs\n\n3) C Jam Blues: this is a 12-bar blues tune with a straightfoward melody. Learning how to play a blues tune means you can apply the same skills across the numerous other songs that share the same form.\nhers a cool version of it with Ella Fitzgerald scatting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osI1QoRgxiU\n\nFeel free to practice the tunes before coming and if needed bring sheet music with you (IMP!: we don't provide print outs).\n\nWhen you RSVP, please state your instrument. We can only take a max of two base players, two pianists , two drummers, and 4 guitar players. Once we reach the max for these we cannot take any more registrants.\n\nOnce enough people have registered you will receive an email confirmation of your placement/slot.\n\nIn the studio there is a piano, drum kit, bass and guitar amps, enough stands, and microphones. A contribution of £10 made by each participant is to cover the cost of hiring the studio along with all the professional equipment in it .\n\nwith love,\n\nCo-organisers Hanan & Xie",

Gdansk. This latin tune is not too difficult to play but a lot of fun. You can find the lead sheet here https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2ecrfwy8xircuin/AAByKmOr5gY90eV498FDotsFa?dl=0\n\n2). Blue Monk in Bb. Learning to play the blues is a versatile and important skill!\n\n3) Caravan in F-. This song, of whiplash fame, does not have a complex chord progression so it's a great opportunity to work on your improvisation\n\n4) On Green Dolphin Street in C. A jazz classic - and a more challenging tune with modal changes and a fairly complexity form\n\nYou'll make the most of the session if you practice beforehand! Feel free to make use of youtube tutorials and practice with backing tracks. (The app iReal pro is useful for providing backing tracks where you can adjust things like tempo/style.) At the same time don't worry if you feel like you still have a long way to go - we all do! Drop me a note if you're looking for some specific tips.\n\nWe won't be providing lead sheets so please bring yours with you if needed.\n\n**Equipment**\nIn the studio there is a piano, drum kit (no cymbals), bass and guitar amps, stands, and microphones.\nIf you play the drums you'll need to bring cymbals (or you can pay £8 to rent from the studio)\n\nLook forward to seeing you there!\nXie",

Here's the plan:\n\n- Meet at 17.00 at the Royal Festival Hall, just inside the doorways next to the Nelson Mandela statue (will wait until 17.15 - send me a message if you can't find us)\n\n- Head down for the Trinity Laban Jazz Orchestra Showcase (starting at 17.45). The event is free, performed by students at Trinity Laban, and also featuring Mercury Prize nominated trumpeter Laura Jurd\n\n- Once this has finished we'll head over to the pub, Fountain & Ink (SE1 9LY) 10 mins walk away. Not sure when exactly this will be (maybe around 8), but feel free to meet us there if you're only free later on. They are known for good pizzas and according to Google not too busy on Saturdays.\n\nAny questions just let me know. If you want to find out where we are on the day drop me a message on Meetup (not as a comment on the event as I can't get notifications for those).\n\nSee you then,\nXie",

You're not obliged to stay for the whole session, but if you're drums or bass (i.e. the most important!) do let me know if you can only make a part of it\n* Level: as a rough guide, you'd be expected to have played 30+ jazz standards, and near a point where you no longer need sheet music for at least a few songs\n* Calling songs: choose most of your songs from top 100/200 most commonly called jazz tunes\ne.g. https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-jazz-workshop/the-top-200-jazz-tunes-everyone-should-know/366418443479460/\nor\nhttps://www.hopestreetmusicstudios.com/articles/100-must-know-jazz-tunes\nYou're free to choose from outside them, but if many others haven't even heard the song we may skip to another\n* Also, if you're calling a song, ideally you know it like the back of your hand and are familiar with at least a few recorded versions\n* Singers: please know what key you'd like to call a song in\n\nIf you're not sure you'd get much out of the session, just drop me a note or come say hi at one of then setlist jams.\n\nAs before:\n\nWe're trying out a new format - like the familiar pub/bar jam, everyone can call songs they'd like to play.\n\n- A chance to focus on more nuanced aspects of playing - listening, responding, communicating, building the sound together\n- Discussion and feedback encouraged\n- Attendee numbers limited so everyone gets plenty of playing time\n- Assumes basic ability to follow the form / accompany / improvise, and caters to those who are looking to challenge themselves beyond that\n- Usual relaxed friendly vibe\n\nPlease sign up before attending\n\n**Equipment**\nIn both studios there is a piano, drum kit (no cymbals), bass and guitar amps, stands, and microphones. Drummers: please bring cymbals (or can be rented for £8)\n\nLook forward to it and feel free to get in touch with any questions\nXie",

        "description": "*full for drums, bass, piano*\n*only 15.45-18.00 this Saturday as many people are on holiday*\n\nA chance to focus on more nuanced aspects of playing - listening, responding, communicating, building the sound together! Attendees take turns to call songs for this session.\n\nPlease note before signing up:\n\n* I'll assume you can make the full session (1.30pm-6pm), but if not please let me know if you can do either 1.30pm-4pm or 3.30pm-6pm\n\n* Level: as a rough guide, you'd be expected to have played 30+ jazz standards, comfortable following the form / comping / improvising\n\n* Format: like the familiar pub/bar jam, everyone can call songs they'd like to play\n\n* Calling tunes: choose mostly from top 100/200 most commonly called jazz standards\ne.g. https://www.hopestreetmusicstudios.com/articles/100-must-know-jazz-tunes\nYou're free to choose from outside them, but if most others haven't heard/played the song we may skip to another\n\n* If you're calling a song, make sure to know it well and are familiar with at least a few recorded versions\n\n* Singers: please know what key you'd like to call a song in\n\nIf you're not sure you'd get much out of the session, just drop me a note or come say hi at one of then setlist jams.\n\nPlease sign up before attending\n\n**Equipment**\nIn both studios there is a piano, drum kit (no cymbals), bass and guitar amps, stands, and microphones. Drummers: please bring cymbals (or can be rented for £8)\n\nLook forward to it and feel free to get in touch with any questions\nXie",

My name is Jay and I am a British “Grown” Chinese. Therefore English has become my first language whilst Mandarin and Cantonese has sadly become my second. I believe there are lots of you like me who would love to learn, or improve their Chinese because you too believe it would open your world to much more opportunities. As it slowly becomes a consuming economy, China is where the money is. If you happen to be going to China soon, being able to speak the language on a basic level will undoubtedly get you much further, both in terms of experience and money. You might even meet your new best friend here and we all know there is nothing better than having a local show you around their country.\n\nWhat’s better than learning Chinese by speaking it to a native? This is where you will find those who will be happy to speak, as well as teach you their native language, and all they ask for in return is you speaking to them in yours. Everybody wins, it really can’t get easier than that.\n\nHere are the questions that I guess are in your mind right now and I will answer them one by one.\n\n“Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?”\n\n- No, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for half the session.\n\n“I don’t know any Chinese at all, would I end up not speaking for half the session and get nothing out of this in the end?”\n\n- No, what is unique about us is that most of each session will be dedicated to playing various games or team building exercises that require only a few key sentences or phrases. We will go through those before we start the games. Since you will be using it immediately and repeatedly, you will being to understand the meaning behind each word that compose the sentence, and you will never forget it again.\n\n“I will only be learning a few phrases each session?”\n\n- Yes, but only at first. After a few sessions, your repertoire will be much bigger, and you will also begin to learn much faster because you can begin to associate different words together to make your own sentences. To us, quality is more important than quantity, even if you learned every sentence in a book in one session, it is useless if you forget it or don’t know how to use it. It’s always better to understand the words that make up only a few sentences than blindly remembering hundreds of sentences.\n\nLastly, we are a family here, we help each other, have fun and are open to suggestions. We will feel our time is increasingly well spent here, because as we improve individually, so will we as a whole.\n\nIf it’s your first time here, we will introduce ourselves to you at the door and introduce you to a few people in our group. There is no need to be anxious about not knowing where to sit or having to introduce yourself. And the best part is, because everyone is focused on the game they are playing, you don’t have to worry all eyes being on you the moment you come through the door. The next time you are here, we will introduce you to a few new people, and in no time you will naturally be a part of our family.\n\nCome join us and easily take away something amazing. We hope to see you soon.\n\nJay and Michael\n\nRequired of members:\n\nHave a sincere attitude to learning, be considerate to others and finally, to have fun.",

        "description": "Language Exchange - English & Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese)\n\nOur goal: To naturally improve verbal communication skills in Mandarin or Cantonese through cooperation in various games and team building exercises.\n\nPrice: Free\n\nOur motto: We learn by playing.\n\nHi everyone! My name is Jay and I am a British “Grown” Chinese. Therefore English has become my first language whilst Mandarin and Cantonese has sadly become my second. I believe there are lots of you like me who would love to learn, or improve their Chinese because you too believe it would open your world to much more opportunities. As it slowly becomes a consuming economy, China is where the money is. If you happen to be going to China soon, being able to speak the language on a basic level will undoubtedly get you much further, both in terms of experience and money. You might even meet your new best friend here and we all know there is nothing better than having a local show you around their country.\n\nWhat’s better than learning Chinese by speaking it to a native? This is where you will find those who will be happy to speak, as well as teach you their native language, and all they ask for in return is you speaking to them in yours. Everybody wins, it really can’t get easier than that.\n\nHere are the questions that I guess are in your mind right now and I will answer them one by one.\n\n“Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?”\n\n- No, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for half the session.\n\n“I don’t know any Chinese at all, would I end up not speaking for half the session and get nothing out of this in the end?”\n\n- No, what is unique about us is that most of each session will be dedicated to playing various games or team building exercises that require only a few key sentences or phrases. We will go through those before we start the games. Since you will be using it immediately and repeatedly, you will being to understand the meaning behind each word that compose the sentence, and you will never forget it again.\n\n“I will only be learning a few phrases each session?”\n\n- Yes, but only at first. After a few sessions, your repertoire will be much bigger, and you will also begin to learn much faster because you can begin to associate different words together to make your own sentences. To us, quality is more important than quantity, even if you learned every sentence in a book in one session, it is useless if you forget it or don’t know how to use it. It’s always better to understand the words that make up only a few sentences than blindly remembering hundreds of sentences.\n\nLastly, we are a family here, we help each other, have fun and are open to suggestions. We will feel our time is increasingly well spent here, because as we improve individually, so will we as a whole.\n\nIf it’s your first time here, we will introduce ourselves to you at the door and introduce you to a few people in our group. There is no need to be anxious about not knowing where to sit or having to introduce yourself. And the best part is, because everyone is focused on the game they are playing, you don’t have to worry all eyes being on you the moment you come through the door. The next time you are here, we will introduce you to a few new people, and in no time you will naturally be a part of our family.\n\nCome join us and easily take away something amazing. We hope to see you soon.\n\nJay and Michael\n\nRequired of members:\n\nHave a sincere attitude to learning, be considerate to others and finally, to have fun.",

Since you will be using it immediately and repeatedly, you will being to understand the meaning behind each word that compose the sentence, and you will never forget it again.\n\n“I will only be learning a few phrases each session?”\n\n- Yes, but only at first. After a few sessions, your repertoire will be much bigger, and you will also begin to learn much faster because you can begin to associate different words together to make your own sentences. To us, quality is more important than quantity, even if you learned every sentence in a book in one session, it is useless if you forget it or don’t know how to use it. It’s always better to understand the words that make up only a few sentences than blindly remembering hundreds of sentences.\n\nLastly, we are a family here, we help each other, have fun and are open to suggestions. We will feel our time is increasingly well spent here, because as we improve individually, so will we as a whole.\n\nIf it’s your first time here, we will introduce ourselves to you at the door and introduce you to a few people in our group. There is no need to be anxious about not knowing where to sit or having to introduce yourself. And the best part is, because everyone is focused on the game they are playing, you don’t have to worry all eyes being on you the moment you come through the door. The next time you are here, we will introduce you to a few new people, and in no time you will naturally be a part of our family.\n\nCome join us and easily take away something amazing.

It’s always better to understand the words that make up only a few sentences than blindly remembering hundreds of sentences.\n\nLastly, we are a family here, we help each other, have fun and are open to suggestions. We will feel our time is increasingly well spent here, because as we improve individually, so will we as a whole.\n\nIf it’s your first time here, we will introduce ourselves to you at the door and introduce you to a few people in our group. There is no need to be anxious about not knowing where to sit or having to introduce yourself. And the best part is, because everyone is focused on the game they are playing, you don’t have to worry all eyes being on you the moment you come through the door. The next time you are here, we will introduce you to a few new people, and in no time you will naturally be a part of our family.\n\nCome join us and easily take away something amazing. We hope to see you soon.\n\nJay and Michael\n\nRequired of members:\n\nHave a sincere attitude to learning, be considerate to others and finally, to have fun.",

My name is Jay and I am a British “Grown” Chinese. Therefore English has become my first language whilst Mandarin and Cantonese has sadly become my second. I believe there are lots of you like me who would love to learn, or improve their Chinese because you too believe it would open your world to much more opportunities. As it slowly becomes a consuming economy, China is where the money is. If you happen to be going to China soon, being able to speak the language on a basic level will undoubtedly get you much further, both in terms of experience and money. You might even meet your new best friend here and we all know there is nothing better than having a local show you around their country.\n\nWhat’s better than learning Chinese by speaking it to a native? This is where you will find those who will be happy to speak, as well as teach you their native language, and all they ask for in return is you speaking to them in yours. Everybody wins, it really can’t get easier than that.\n\nHere are the questions that I guess are in your mind right now and I will answer them one by one.\n\n“Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?”\n\n- No, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for half the session.\n\n“I don’t know any Chinese at all, would I end up not speaking for half the session and get nothing out of this in the end?”\n\n- No, what is unique about us is that most of each session will be dedicated to playing various games or team building exercises that require only a few key sentences or phrases. We will go through those before we start the games. Since you will be using it immediately and repeatedly, you will being to understand the meaning behind each word that compose the sentence, and you will never forget it again.\n\n“I will only be learning a few phrases each session?”\n\n- Yes, but only at first.

If you have never been to our session before, please still come along as our existing members will be there playing various games in Mandarin, Cantonese and English. They are amazing people and will introduce themselves to you when you arrive. There is only one rule! everyone has to speak English in the first hour, and then Chinese in the second hour. This ensures everyone gets to improve on their desired language. In the meantime, sorry I couldn’t be there to meet you all (and for the the possible lack of structure and new games in the sessions), but I look forward to seeing you all again on the 14th of October. Jay\n\n*大家好，想先告诉你们一声，因为旅游的关系，我之后的三个周天都不能带领这个活动。但是，这个活动会继续在同一个地方和时间进行，让我们现有的成员聚会。如果你之前没来过，也一样可以来，因为我们的成员还会在那里玩游戏和聊天，而它们对你也会是无限的欢迎。你一到，它们会尽力跟你自我介绍，把你带入群里。我们只有一条规矩，就是第一个小时所有人要说英语，第二个小时说中文。这样所有人都能学到它们想学的语言。很抱歉，如果因为我的缺席而令到这聚会暂时缺乏结构和游戏上的创新，但我期待着10月14号能见到你们的那一天。Jay\n\n(中文介绍可以在这里看的到: https://www.meetup.com/Chinese-Mandarin-Cantonese-English-Language-Exchange/events/)\n\nOur goal: To naturally improve verbal communication skills in Mandarin or Cantonese through cooperation in various games and team building exercises.\n\nPrice: Free\n\nOur motto: We learn by playing.\n\nHi everyone!

This is where you will find those who will be happy to speak, as well as teach you their native language, and all they ask for in return is you speaking to them in yours. Everybody wins, it really can’t get easier than that.\n\nHere are the questions that I guess are in your mind right now and I will answer them one by one.\n\n“Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?”\n\n- No, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for half the session.\n\n“I don’t know any Chinese at all, would I end up not speaking for half the session and get nothing out of this in the end?”\n\n- No, what is unique about us is that most of each session will be dedicated to playing various games or team building exercises that require only a few key sentences or phrases. We will go through those before we start the games. Since you will be using it immediately and repeatedly, you will being to understand the meaning behind each word that compose the sentence, and you will never forget it again.\n\n“I will only be learning a few phrases each session?”\n\n- Yes, but only at first. After a few sessions, your repertoire will be much bigger, and you will also begin to learn much faster because you can begin to associate different words together to make your own sentences. To us, quality is more important than quantity, even if you learned every sentence in a book in one session, it is useless if you forget it or don’t know how to use it. It’s always better to understand the words that make up only a few sentences than blindly remembering hundreds of sentences.\n\nLastly, we are a family here, we help each other, have fun and are open to suggestions. We will feel our time is increasingly well spent here, because as we improve individually, so will we as a whole.\n\nIf it’s your first time here, we will introduce ourselves to you at the door and introduce you to a few people in our group. There is no need to be anxious about not knowing where to sit or having to introduce yourself. And the best part is, because everyone is focused on the game they are playing, you don’t have to worry all eyes being on you the moment you come through the door. The next time you are here, we will introduce you to a few new people, and in no time you will naturally be a part of our family.\n\nCome join us and easily take away something amazing. We hope to see you soon.\n\nJay\n\nRequired of members:\n\nHave a sincere attitude to learning, be considerate to others and finally, to have fun.",

To us, quality is more important than quantity, even if you learned every sentence in a book in one session, it is useless if you forget it or don’t know how to use it. It’s always better to understand the words that make up only a few sentences than blindly remembering hundreds of sentences.\n\nLastly, we are a family here, we help each other, have fun and are open to suggestions. We will feel our time is increasingly well spent here, because as we improve individually, so will we as a whole.\n\nIf it’s your first time here, we will introduce ourselves to you at the door and introduce you to a few people in our group. There is no need to be anxious about not knowing where to sit or having to introduce yourself. And the best part is, because everyone is focused on the game they are playing, you don’t have to worry all eyes being on you the moment you come through the door. The next time you are here, we will introduce you to a few new people, and in no time you will naturally be a part of our family.\n\nCome join us and easily take away something amazing. We hope to see you soon.\n\nJay\n\nRequired of members:\n\nHave a sincere attitude to learning, be considerate to others and finally, to have fun.",

Otherwise, its £1 (so that we can buy new games for the session)\n\nOur motto: We learn by playing.\n\nHi everyone! My name is Jay and I am a British “Grown” Chinese. Therefore English has become my first language whilst Mandarin and Cantonese has sadly become my second. I believe there are lots of you like me who would love to learn, or improve their Chinese because you too believe it would open your world to much more opportunities. As it slowly becomes a consuming economy, China is where the money is. If you happen to be going to China soon, being able to speak the language on a basic level will undoubtedly get you much further, both in terms of experience and money. You might even meet your new best friend here and we all know there is nothing better than having a local show you around their country.\n\nWhat’s better than learning Chinese by speaking it to a native? This is where you will find those who will be happy to speak, as well as teach you their native language, and all they ask for in return is you speaking to them in yours. Everybody wins, it really can’t get easier than that.\n\nHere are the questions that I guess are in your mind right now and I will answer them one by one.\n\n“Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?”\n\n- No, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for half the session.\n\n“I don’t know any Chinese at all, would I end up not speaking for half the session and get nothing out of this in the end?”\n\n- No, what is unique about us is that most of each session will be dedicated to playing various games or team building exercises that require only a few key sentences or phrases. We will go through those before we start the games. Since you will be using it immediately and repeatedly, you will being to understand the meaning behind each word that compose the sentence, and you will never forget it again.\n\n“I will only be learning a few phrases each session?”\n\n- Yes, but only at first.

Otherwise, its £1 (so that we can buy new games for the session)\n\nOur motto: We learn by playing.\n\nHi everyone! My name is Jay and I am a British “Grown” Chinese. Therefore English has become my first language whilst Mandarin and Cantonese has sadly become my second. I believe there are lots of you like me who would love to learn, or improve their Chinese because you too believe it would open your world to much more opportunities. As it slowly becomes a consuming economy, China is where the money is. If you happen to be going to China soon, being able to speak the language on a basic level will undoubtedly get you much further, both in terms of experience and money. You might even meet your new best friend here and we all know there is nothing better than having a local show you around their country.\n\nWhat’s better than learning Chinese by speaking it to a native? This is where you will find those who will be happy to speak, as well as teach you their native language, and all they ask for in return is you speaking to them in yours. Everybody wins, it really can’t get easier than that.\n\nHere are the questions that I guess are in your mind right now and I will answer them one by one.\n\n“Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?”\n\n- No, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for half the session.\n\n“I don’t know any Chinese at all, would I end up not speaking for half the session and get nothing out of this in the end?”\n\n- No, what is unique about us is that most of each session will be dedicated to playing various games or team building exercises that require only a few key sentences or phrases. We will go through those before we start the games. Since you will be using it immediately and repeatedly, you will being to understand the meaning behind each word that compose the sentence, and you will never forget it again.\n\n“I will only be learning a few phrases each session?”\n\n- Yes, but only at first. After a few sessions, your repertoire will be much bigger, and you will also begin to learn much faster because you can begin to associate different words together to make your own sentences. To us, quality is more important than quantity, even if you learned every sentence in a book in one session, it is useless if you forget it or don’t know how to use it. It’s always better to understand the words that make up only a few sentences than blindly remembering hundreds of sentences.\n\nLastly, we are a family here, we help each other, have fun and are open to suggestions. We will feel our time is increasingly well spent here, because as we improve individually, so will we as a whole.\n\nIf it’s your first time here, we will introduce ourselves to you at the door and introduce you to a few people in our group. There is no need to be anxious about not knowing where to sit or having to introduce yourself. And the best part is, because everyone is focused on the game they are playing, you don’t have to worry all eyes being on you the moment you come through the door. The next time you are here, we will introduce you to a few new people, and in no time you will naturally be a part of our family.\n\nCome join us and easily take away something amazing.
