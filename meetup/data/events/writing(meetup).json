The challenge involves reading the Eye of Argon without laughing or hesitating, passing the book on to the next reader once you do.\n\nSo feel free to come along and we will be back to usual in January.\n\nJust to note that The Lamb has an upstairs so we will likely be there.

        "description": "Our Writer's Feedback Meetup gives you the chance to share your work with other writers/readers. All genres of writing are welcome. If you simply want to read and provide writers with feedback, please join this meetup!\n\nWe've got a DropBox folder where I will upload excerpts for the meetup. The idea is that readers will download and read the work prior to the event in order to give in depth feedback. If you wish to participate, I will need your email address to send you the link. You can send me a direct message with that info. If I have your email info already I'll send the link (if you plan on joining us).\n\nOne of our members has already graciously offered to go first, but there's space for 1 - 2 more writers! First come first serve, so please indicate your interest in the comments.\n\nExcerpt Guidelines:\n- Kindly forward your excerpt to me by January 7th to give everyone enough time to read it by January 17th.\n- Try to keep the excerpt at around 3000 words (12 - 13 pages double spaced). There is, of course, some flexibility to this (for example, you have a chapter that's 15 pages or a short story closer to 4000 words, etc.).\n- What kind of feedback are you looking for? Provide this info in a comment. It will help us readers to know what to focus on.\n\nLooking forward to giving this a go . . . see you there!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES: Feedback MUST be constructive. If you read a member's work it is understood that it is confidential and you will not share that members work publicly (or elsewhere). All members are responsible for their food and drink.",

        "description": "Our Writer's Feedback Meetup gives you the chance to share your work with other writers/readers. All genres of writing are welcome. We've got time for 2 excerpts. First come first serve, so please indicate your interest in the comments or send me a message. (If you simply want to read and provide writers with feedback, please join this meetup!)\n\nWe've got a DropBox folder where I will upload excerpts for the meetup. The idea is that readers will download and read the work prior to the event in order to give in depth feedback.\n\nExcerpt Guidelines:\n- Kindly forward your excerpt to me by Monday, April 8th to give everyone enough time to read before the meeting.\n- Try to keep the excerpt at around 3000 words (12 - 13 pages double spaced). There is, of course, some flexibility to this (for example, you have a chapter that's 15 pages or a short story closer to 4000 words, etc.).\n- What kind of feedback are you looking for? Provide this info in a comment. It will help us readers to know what to focus on.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES: Feedback MUST be constructive. If you read a member's work it is understood that it is confidential and you will not share that members work publicly (or elsewhere). All members are responsible for their food and drink.",

To do so, I will end the Zoom component of the meeting after 20 to 30 minutes so that we can all write for an hour without the feeling of being spied upon through our webcams! I will then restart the Zoom meeting and you will be able to rejoin using the same link.\n\nWhat to expect:\nFor this meeting, all you need is an idea and something to write with (laptop, or pen and paper). All skill levels and genres of writing are welcome. In this meeting, we do not set writing exercises or suggest themes - attendees are free to work on (or start) any writing project of their choice. It's your space and time to use as you wish.\n\nWe'll start off the meeting with introductions and a bit of a chat (which usually runs about 30 minutes). Then, we'll start writing for about an hour and will end with some time for questions, comments, and an opportunity to share something about what you've written with the group if you wish (though this is by no means expected - we also hold regular, more formal, feedback meetings.)",

A frequent topic was what books we’d read and that is what we’ll be concentrating on tonight.\n\nMany of us have been fascinated by the copiously filled bookcases behind the interviewees that we’ve seen during lockdown so we thought we’d ask you to bring a book along and introduce it to us. If you haven’t got the actual book just the name and author are fine. Give us a brief description of what it is about and anything else you want to say about it - what it meant to you, or what the writing was like.\n\nThen we will open it up to a brief discussion- has anyone else read it, what did they get out of it or did they not get on with it. Does it remind us of other books. Would we like to read it? We’ll keep the time for each book to about ten minutes and any extra time at the end for more discussion. Do bring your own snacks and drink.\n\nHappy reading 📖! Irene",

Anyone that doesn't get a turn this time we will prioritize for the next one.\n\nWhat do I read to the group? Anything you have written - a work in progress; a first draft; a finished piece. Anything that you'd like to share and get some immediate responses to.\n\nDo I submit my work in advance? No, the object of the exercise is to get an immediate first impression response from members after you read the piece out.\n\nThe aim is to encourage our writing by having this space to share it and getting some spontaneous responses. We ask as always that this should be constructive and positive. It will be great to hear what we’re all working on.\n\nPlease note this will not be the same as our more formal feedback sessions where we submit a more substantial piece (up to 3000 words) in advance, giving everyone a chance to study it properly and give considered and detailed feedback.",

She started her career writing heartfelt but humorous romances for Mills & Boon, but now writes romantic comedies and feel-good women’s fiction for Harper Collins, as part of their HQ imprint.

Simply, an agent can fast-track your manuscript on to the desk of the right commissioning editor who will give it serious consideration.\n\nAnd then there's negotiating the advance, contracts, sale of TV and film rights... all the stuff that can keep you from getting on with your next book/script/poetry collection/play!\n\nBut how do you find an agent? How do you know what they're looking for? How do you know what you should be asking them?\n\nGuy Rose of FRA Literary Agents has three decades of experience, representing authors of books, film and TV scripts and stage plays. In conversation with FRA client and Sutton Writers member Simon Woodham, he'll be giving us an insider's view on the current state of publishing and more. And there will be time for you to put your own questions during and after the discussion.\n\n**********\n\nNEW MEMBERS ALWAYS WELCOME\n\nMembers: The full annual membership fee includes admission to our monthly meeting.

Winsome has had over 15 plays produced and won lots of awards, including the Thames Television Award for best play of the year. She was the first black woman to have a play produced at the National Theatre with Leave Taking in 1988. The Guardian described her as “the godmother of black British playwrights.” Not only is she an illustrious playwright but she’s also a senior lecturer at Kingston University. Winsome is a truly inspirational figure and we look forward to her talk.\n\n**********\n\nNEW MEMBERS ALWAYS WELCOME\n\nMembers: The full annual membership fee includes admission to our monthly meeting.

If you’re feeling this, and want to make progress, come along to our next Writing Session!\n\nBring yourself, your laptop/paper and pen, buy a drink and sit amongst your fellow writers (in creative silence!) to get some work done on your own current project.\n\nThis isn’t a social gathering, a collaborative project, or a workshop. We won’t be chatting or reading each other’s work to give feedback, just sitting together to work individually on our own projects.\n\nIf you’re bringing a laptop, make sure it’s fully charged as there may not be plugs available. Then grab yourself a drink and join us!\n\nIf you’d like to come, we will be in the Cock & Bull pub at the top of Sutton high street. Please RSVP on Meetup so Paul knows how big a table to book.\n\nHope to see you there!",

        "description": "Sutton Writers are very pleased to have Lucy Furlong join us to talk about the amazing Annie Kenney and the 100 DAYS project, which has highlighted so many stories and given new perspectives into people's lives during the First World War.\n\nIn partnership with the Imperial War Museum, the 100 DAYS project engaged 100 volunteer writers from 26 Characters Ltd, a not-for-profit organisation representing a diverse group of people who share a love of words. Each writer created a 100 word piece (a centena) inspired by and based on the life of a real individual who experienced the First World War. The centenas are being released daily, from 5th August to 12th November, each day showcasing the work of different members of the Partnership.\n\nLucy Furlong chose Annie Kenney, the only working class suffragette on the board of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU). Her challenge was to give Annie her voice, and in 100 words, show her vital contribution to women getting the vote in 1918.\n\nLucy Furlong's centena was published on August 11th, along with a film of her reading her poem in the Peace Garden at the Imperial War Museum.\n\nWeb link here:\n\nhttp://www.1914.org/armistice-100-days/centenas/votes-for-women-by-lucy-furlong/\n\n**********\n\nNEW MEMBERS ALWAYS WELCOME\n\nMembers: The full annual membership fee includes admission to our monthly meeting.

Visit rachelknightley.com or DM to ask questions/say hello!\n\n**Week 1: Goal-setting**\nSometimes a busy or stressful time means dealing with the ‘immediate’ in our lives constantly and the ‘important’ more rarely. This can mean what we want takes a back-seat to what we fear. Today is a chance to connect with each other, reconnect with ourselves and explore relaxing and intriguing coaching tools to focus on what you enjoy, love, value, and what steps can connect your wishes and hopes to your habits and goals for the work, art and life you want.\n**Week 2:** **Characterisation – in Life** **and Art!**\nWho are the characters that we carry in our minds, whose opinions, wishes and values affect our decision-making? Both in our fiction and day-to-day life, today is an opportunity to get to know those voices, ask what they want, and ask yourself whether you still want them as major or minor characters. Enjoy a mix of exercises to bring your own voice out of the chorus, and actively select which voices get to stay in your backing group!\n**Week 3: Plotting – The Story So Far**\nToday we explore the relationship between character and plot: how events create characters, but also how characters, as they change, change the world around them as a result. Enjoy a mix of practical exercises, story tools and problem-solving activities to make your story grow your way. These techniques will work for decisions on the page as well as those you make in work, at home and with family and friends.\n**Week 4:** **Time and Place**\nToday we’ll look at what it means to feel present in your life and story, and how that sense of being present allows you to experience and utilise your time. Make un-rushed, value-centred choices about what you do, how and who you spend your time with and what you give space to in life and on the page. Explore and develop incisive questions for your unique story, on the page and off it!\n**Week 5: Freedom Not Fear: Approaching the Blank Page**\nWhen you are clear about your character’s objective, it’s much easier to know what dialogue and actions they will select. This is just as true in life as it is on the page or on the stage. Today, we’ll be using tools, activities and resources to explore self-direction and value-aligned action. Bring “show don’t tell” into your boundaries in work and life, and into the quality of your creative and professional writing.\n**Week 6:** **Moving Forward**\nA celebration and summary of the discoveries you’ve made in art, work and life. Requests welcome for any favourite exercises to revisit, as we honour the journeys so far and plan for what happens next. Looking back to goal-setting in week 1, what are the things that were important to you then and how are you going to keep the ‘important’ above water when the ‘immediate’ is all around?\n\nBook weekly through Meetup or book the full course at www.greeninkwritersgym.com",

Exercises to liberate and encourage free movement around your thoughts, feelings and questions about the world all of which will inform your stories.\n**Week 2: Through These Eyes: Getting to Know Your Protagonist**\nYour central character is the reader’s – and writer’s – eyes and ears on the world. Whether they’re based closely on you or not like you at all, this week’s exercises and extracts will help you use your own life, thoughts and feelings as fuel to discover who they are and where they’re taking the story.\n**Week 3: Raising Personal Stakes: Plot** **and Theme for Fiction and Memoir**\nWhat your story is about will be the essence of what your character has to face. Developing on what you’ve learnt about them, today we ask what’s the worst thing that can happen to them, who they are (or want to be) and how do they grow by the events of the plot?\n**Week 4: Framing the Journey**: **Beginnings and Endings**\nThe more you know about your characters, plot and theme, the freer you will be to decide how you want to present your story to your reader. Should it be chronological? Or is there a later event that, if revealed earlier, will ensure we’re hooked? Explore different shapes and routes your story’s journey could take.\n**Week 5: Short and Long Form: A Moment or a Process**?\nToday we’ll explore the differences between short and long-form memoir and fiction. We’ll use techniques to identify the key moment of change around which you can shape a compelling narrative through use of pace and momentum.\n**Week 6: Live Editing**\nSelect an extract of your current work-in-progress to receive live editorial feedback. Today will be a tour of the process from conceptual discussions to how, when the time comes, you will work with an editor on line-editing.",

Explore and develop incisive questions for your unique story, on the page and off it!\n**Week 5: Freedom Not Fear: Approaching the Blank Page**\nWhen you are clear about your character’s objective, it’s much easier to know what dialogue and actions they will select. This is just as true in life as it is on the page or on the stage. Today, we’ll be using tools, activities and resources to explore self-direction and value-aligned action. Bring “show don’t tell” into your boundaries in work and life, and into the quality of your creative and professional writing.\n**Week 6:** **Moving Forward**\nA celebration and summary of the discoveries you’ve made in art, work and life. Requests welcome for any favourite exercises to revisit, as we honour the journeys so far and plan for what happens next. Looking back to goal-setting in week 1, what are the things that were important to you then and how are you going to keep the ‘important’ above water when the ‘immediate’ is all around?\n\nBook weekly through Meetup or book the full course at www.greeninkwritersgym.com",

Optional feedback slots are available to everyone who enrols for the full course (minimum of two per writer, 2500-word maximum per slot).\n\nDr Rachel Knightley is a fiction and non-fiction author, presenter and business and personal development coach. She trained in Teaching Creative Writing at the University of Cambridge and is completing her PGCert with Barefoot Coaching and the Uviersity of Chester in autumn 2022. Visit rachelknightley.com or ask questions/say hello by direct message here!\n\n£42.50 per session or book for the full course at www.greeninkwritersgym.com\n\n**Week 1: Writing Mindset: Using Your Artist’s Palette**\nMastering access to the full range of memory and imagination that every writer mixes to create their unique voice and story. Exercises to liberate and encourage free movement around your thoughts, feelings and questions about the world all of which will inform your stories.\n**Week 2: Through These Eyes: Getting to Know Your Protagonist**\nYour central character is the reader’s – and writer’s – eyes and ears on the world. Whether they’re based closely on you or not like you at all, this week’s exercises and extracts will help you use your own life, thoughts and feelings as fuel to discover who they are and where they’re taking the story.\n**Week 3: Raising Personal Stakes: Plot** **and Theme for Fiction and Memoir**\nWhat your story is about will be the essence of what your character has to face. Developing on what you’ve learnt about them, today we ask what’s the worst thing that can happen to them, who they are (or want to be) and how do they grow by the events of the plot?\n**Week 4: Framing the Journey**: **Beginnings and Endings**\nThe more you know about your characters, plot and theme, the freer you will be to decide how you want to present your story to your reader. Should it be chronological? Or is there a later event that, if revealed earlier, will ensure we’re hooked? Explore different shapes and routes your story’s journey could take.\n**Week 5: Short and Long Form: A Moment or a Process**?\nToday we’ll explore the differences between short and long-form memoir and fiction. We’ll use techniques to identify the key moment of change around which you can shape a compelling narrative through use of pace and momentum.\n**Week 6: Live Editing**\nSelect an extract of your current work-in-progress to receive live editorial feedback. Today will be a tour of the process from conceptual discussions to how, when the time comes, you will work with an editor on line-editing.",

Please contact Gemma on hello@write-and-shine.com to add your name to the waiting list.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n**Language of Colour**\n**Thursday 28 July (7.15-9am)**\n\nTo close our season, we’ll host a special workshop on colour and language. We’ll look to writers Derek Jarman, Leanne Shapton, Ocean Vuong and Virginia Woolf who considered colour not just as decoration but as a tool to allow their imaginations to soar and bring their ideas to life.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWrite & Shine offers a programme of early morning writing workshops, retreats, and an online library of self-guided courses.\n\nDuring June and July, we’ll host morning writing workshops and events inspired by summertime’s warmth, light and colour.\n\nThe programme runs virtually via Zoom, UK time. A link to the Zoom meeting is sent by email 24 hours.\n\n***\n\nOur sessions are ideal for both beginners & those needed a burst of creativity as we don't share any writing produced. The focus is on generating new material and tapping into your imagination in the morning.\n\nThis workshop is £22. Please bring a notebook and a pen, or if you prefer to use a computer ensure it's fully charged!\n\nBook in advance to secure your place. Book your place on the Write & Shine website.

Tickets are £15 and will be bought/booked all together. I'm not including 3D glasses in case people already have them.\n\nNOTE: TICKETS WILL BE PURCHASED ON THURSDAY NIGHT! If people register after that, I'll do my best to book them in as close to where the first group is sitting. So, ASAP as soon as you can!\n\nThe Cineworld in West India Quay is top shelf, big comfy seats. We'll head over to the pub afterwards for some food and pints as well. Only a few minutes walk from the DLR (West India or Westferry are the closest).\n\nShould be a blast ... looks like this might be a real winner!",

Stories will be critiqued in round-robin speed-date format, so that every submitted story will receive at least a few critiques. Critiques will be assigned to attendees a week before the meeting (2-3), so please sign up early.\n\nAlso, we'll be charging a small amount for this meeting to go towards the venue and the prize winners!

        "description": "This will be the first meetup for our new Novel track. The meeting will revolve around discussing a suitable format going forward, looking at things like:\n\n- meeting frequency\n\n- critique format\n\n- meeting format\n\n- establishing reading/writing genres so that we can pair like-interest groups together\n\nWe'll send out a more detailed overview to the attendees before the meeting itself.\n\nNote that the attendance requirements for this track will be more strict than our critique and other meetings. This is because there is a far greater commitment required in critiquing an entire novel (though it won't be as intensive as for a short story, i.e. don't expect to give or be given line item edits or per-page notes).\n\nAs such, the novel track meetups (including this one) will be restricted to participants who:\n\n- have submitted and had their work critiqued at least once in the regular critique meetings\n\n- are *actively* working on a novel (in process, complete, in revision, etc.). As spaces are likely to be tight, people who aren't actively contributing both content and critiques will likely be asked to give up their spot for somebody who is. We won't be militant about this, but we will be fair.\n\n- are willing to commit to reading 5-10K/month (remembering that critiques for novels are not expected to be anywhere near as thorough as for short stories)\n\nThe idea behind this group is to be as much supportive/encouraging/inspiring as it is constructive (or maybe deconstructive).\n\nSo, if you want to contribute to the discussion of how we'll operate this group, join us on Mar. 15. Again, the above restrictions apply, so if you don't yet fit these requirements, please be patient and we'll find you a spot eventually!",

He is also a guest lecturer at Brunel University for their creative writing course.\n\nDen will be sharing his experiences with us on the trials and tribulations of writing novels, finding inspiration, the importance of community, among other wisdoms and truths.

It can also be a lot of fun and a great creative outlet.\n\nWorkshops are great for stress relief, confidence, and uncovering different perspectives and sometimes surprising insights. It’s also a lovely way to celebrate your ‘you’-ness and realise that you're never alone when you have a pen in your hand.\n\nNo writing talent, knowledge or experience - and definitely no grammar - is required.\n\nFor more information and upcoming workshops, please go to cpsdayoff.com.\n\nThe group will be limited to eight people, so please can I ask you to decline if you're no longer able to make it so someone else can attend. Many thanks!\n\nWriting can be insightful, and we might share things we write (always optional), but please note, this is not a therapy group and isn't suitable for replacement of individual/group therapeutic work.\n\nAbout me\nI'm passionate about sharing life writing techniques including free writing, encouraging people to help (and be OK with) themselves and know that we’re never alone if we have a pen in our hand.

It’s more about capturing a feeling or a tone that can guide our decisions and help us feel that, whilst we might not always be behind the wheel, we’re at least in the front of the car. I've been using annual themes for nearly 10 years now and I can say that they have really helped me.\n\nFree writing is a great tool for uncovering new insights and perspectives and a lovely way to celebrate your ‘you-ness’. No writing talent, knowledge or experience – and definitely no grammar – is required.\n\nDetails\nDate: 12 January 2019\nTime: 1-4pm\nCost is £25.00 (includes tea, coffe and biscuits)\nVenue: Vauxhall Gardens Community Centre is less than a five minute walk from the tube/train/bus station.\n\nThere will be a maximum of 12 people at the workshop but as tickets are being booked through Eventbrite, I'll update the number of available slots as I go along, so the number here to sign up will change.

I'll talk a little about the difference between coaching, mentoring, psychotherapy and counselling, how coaching normally works (length of session/duration/fees), and how to go about finding a coach. Feel free to come along or ask me any questions at cpsdayoff@gmail.com.",

        "description": "Register in advance for this meeting:\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYtcO2rpjIuHNCYiLtIJ43Iroop2O48tmzy\n\nAfter registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.\n\nCome along and experience the joy and value of writing and sharing with others at this free taster session. Journaling is incredibly useful and has many, many benefits. Journaling with others takes things to another level. As well as the accountability of writing with other people, we tend to write differently; often more, than we would on our own. Sharing is at the core of this session (in pairs). It doesn't have to be what you wrote word for word, it could just be how the exercise was for you and anything noteworthy you'd like to share. The writing prompts will help you to surface new insights and ideas, giving you clues as to what needs to happen in your life to get you where you want to be, or just to make it more enjoyable. Best of all, no writing talent, knowledge or experience - and definitely no grammar - is required.\n\nThis session will:\n\n* A chance to 'try before you buy' (my other workshops)\n* Give you some time, just for you\n* Give you the opportunity to do some writing (from prompts)\n* Give you some headspace, perspective and insight\n* Connect you to yourself and others.\n* Give you a lovely shared experience with like minded souls\n\nIt’s creative, supportive and fun, so why not come along and give it a go. You'll leave with some insights, some headspace and satisfaction of an hour well spent, in good company.\n\nPLEASE NOTE you'll need to register via the Zoom link - this is for security purposes. Thank you.\n\nThese session are free, but if you'd like to buy me a coffee (or a Ko-fi!) click here: https://ko-fi.com/cpsdayoff thanks!\n\nI've been running writing workshops and coaching for over three years and run regular sessions giving people the opportunity to write, grow and have fun together.

It’s all just a place to start and then explore what comes through in our writing, whether that's creative, straight journaling or a combination of both.\n\nWriting and sharing (always optional) never fails to connect those taking part in the joys and challenges of being human.

Normal price £49.\n\n**Coach yourself with a Pen - at work and at home**\nUsing techniques from creative writing, journaling, and coaching, you'll connect to yourself more deeply and work through your own live example. You'll leave feeling inspired and energised with some clear next steps and a set of new tools.\n\nYou may just have some fun too whilst tapping into your creativity, which will build your creative confidence. Everyone is creative when it comes to ideas and solutions and these tools will empower you to make the most of bigger opportunities and goals you'd like to achieve.\n\nBringing out your creativity is not only good for your wellbeing and your career (it's one of the most important skills companies need according to LinkedIn and other studies), but it can also give you meaning, help you to solve problems, be more curious about the world around you and ultimately, have a more enjoyable life and feel more confident.\n\nThe tools I'll introduce you to are easy to use, accessible 24/7, playful, creative and great for creating headspace, surfacing new perspectives and facing fear and anxiety to help you get what you want in your life. No experience, interest and definitely no grammar are required.\n\nThese tools are also great for divergent thinking and are really well suited for Design Thinking and Agile ways of working, whether for innovation or reaching goals. They can work with small or large challenges or goals and are suitable for all levels.\n\n**Session one, 21 September**, will be about getting to the bottom of what's happening and what it is you want to achieve/overcome.\n**Session two, 28 September**, will be all about looking forward to what you want and where you want to be.\n\nZoom details are revealed once you book.\n\nI've been running writing workshops and coaching since 2018 and run regular sessions giving people the opportunity to write, grow and have fun together.

This will help you to get the most from a critique of your own work.",

A chance to establish what everyone's aims for the years are, what you are working on and what you hope to get out of the group.\n\n7.30 to 9pm - A chance for willing participants to read out a piece of writing that they have been working on, in order to receive constructive feedback from the group. This is completely voluntary, and I am sure some of the regulars will have been feverishly writing over Christmas.\n\n9pm onwards - Get drunk in the pub downstairs... what better time than a Monday night? In seriousness, we normally have a couple of drinks and some lively debates (sometimes about plays/novels/movies - but often not).\n\nAs this is the first week, we will also discuss if the timings and setup of the group suit everyone, and will adjust accordingly for the subsequent meetups.\n\nThis group was founded last year as a challenge to write a novel or screenplay in a year. It has since evolved into a more general writing group, and the members have often been working on multiple projects.

        "description": "One of the key aspects of fiction writing is developing and using an adept style of writing. There are many elements that go towards this, but for this meet-up we will concentrate on three of these.\n\nThis session will delve into elements that go towards writing and we will concentrate on the fabric (so to speak) of writing style.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This will be an interactive session sitting around a table. So you will discuss and engage with other members of the meeting.\n\nAGENDA:\n\n1. Show, don't tell (Detail/Specifics).\n2. Evocation (Evoking emotions).\n3. Profluence (Profluence).\n\n1. SHOW, DON' TELL:\n\nOne of the most commonly discussed aspects of writing style. - We will discuss this and then try some examples. Starting with some basic 'tell' sentences and then developing them to see how they can be improved.\n\nIn this session there will be around four or more sentences that will be given to the group for jumping off points. Some time will be allowed for the group to chat and come up with suggestions for how the sentence(s) can be developed.\n\nE.G.\n\n- 'John walks down the street to his grandmother's house.'\n\nNothing wrong with the above sentence, but it is not engaging with the reader.\n\nInstead, try writing:\n\n- 'Every step was like walking through mud, as sweat rolled down his cheeks and an impending feeling of doom saturated John’s mind, for he knew that soon he will be at his grandmother’s house.'\n\n2. EVOCATION:\n\nEvoking emotions. This is a sure fire way to engage with your audience. There are many ways to do this and (perhaps worryingly at times) newspapers or websites often do this with great effect even though they are not writing fiction.\n\nCreating an impulsive or engaging feeling that draws in the reader. This can be subtle or have a great effect.\n\nWe will discuss examples and ways of how to do this. Ways to do this could be show injustice, love, vengeance... etc..\n\nWe will also write some example paragraphs that evoke emotions.\n\n3. PROFLUENCE:\n\nMoving your story forward and keeping the reader engaged.\n\nThere are numerous ways to do this and some of these will be discussed.\n\nFor example plot points, creating anticipation, revealing a mystery, etc... Are all ways and methods to keep your reader interested.\n\n-------------\n\nOther Details:\n\n1. Although not 100% necessary - it would be a very good idea to bring along a notepad and pen/pencil.\n\n2. This will be a short session of 1 hour and 30 mins.\n\n3. Please remember to bring a photo ID and scan it at the guest registration tablets at the front desk when you. If your photo ID does not successfully scan, please check in at the tablet as a guest of \"Meetup Event\".\n\n4. Any questions please ask.\n\n5. As the topic of writing style is huge it will concentrate on three aspects and will cover as much as possible in the short time available in this session.\n\n6.

        "description": "In the workshop, we will discuss ideas, structure and plot points that relate to classic victorian ghost stories and in particular those of M.R.James.\n\nThe aim will be for you to learn how to write in a Jamesian style and then in your own time proceed to write a short ghost story.\n\nIf you already have a lot of experience in this genre, please still feel to join and share your knowledge.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAgenda:\n\nThe meetup will be a laid back workshop and participants will be encouraged to engage in the discussion.\n\n1. A short introduction to the Jamesian style.\n\n2. An overview of general approaches to making your writing suspenseful:\n2.1 Limit the POV.\n2.2 Style and form.\n2.3 Dramatic irony.\n\nThen the body of the meetup will be for all to discuss and come up with ideas following the points below - for your own ghost stories.\n\n- We will stop halfway through for a short break of around 10 mins.\n\n3. The Jamesian Style:\n3.1 Location and setting.\n3.2 The main protagonist.\n3.3 An object.\n\nI will bring some specific examples of characters and settings from some of James stories.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTo create the perfect Jamesian ghost story you will need the ingredients below:\n\n1. A quaint, ancient setting. Such as a twee English country village, an estranged seaside town or a stately Abbey. James loved to utilise the antiquity of a colourful setting with an isolated atmosphere.\n\n2. A lady or gentleman protagonist. Many of James’ characters are naive reserved scholars, who are often not convinced something strange is happening until the final climax of the story.\n\n3. A pivotal antiquarian object. Whether an old book or an antique, the discovery of a mystery object that unlocks and attracts an unwelcome figure from beyond the grave is a signature mark of James’ stories.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe story that you produce will be after the meetup, will be at your own pace and in your own time, but it would be great to see your short stories, if you wish to share them, once they have been completed.\n\n-------------------------\n\nJames was a lecturer at Cambridge University and at Christmas time he became well known for reading back his ghost stories.\n\nHe was master of the uncanny, the purveyor of the uncomfortable and a writer renowned for his atmospheric ghostly tales. It was also in Victorian times a tradition to tell ghost stories and one of the most famous ghost stories of all time was set in the Christmas period - that, of course, being \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens.\n\nJameson ghost storytelling was straight down the line and revolved around the idea of real ghosts, not psychological illusions or paranoid affects of the human mind. So if you prefer writing psychological type ghost or horror stories then this workshop may not be for you.\n\n- Just to note - although Jame's stories were published in the Edwardian period, he wrote and shared them primarily during at the end of the Victorian period.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThe writer M.R. James once said: “Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo.… Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.”\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe owner of Frequency Cafe has kindly let us use this space for free. Although you don't have to, please do consider buying a coffee or something to eat if you can.",

        "description": "The previous social meetups have been enjoyable events and the next is 28th Jan.\n\nThis meetup is a casual social for writers who wish to meet other writers in a friendly atmosphere.\n\nThis meetup could be a spring-board for creating relationships with writers that you find common interests with, and potentially for feedback, support, brainstorming and all other matters that relate to writing.\n\nThere is no agenda, but to help guide the conversation for this meetup - please consider the three points below for discussion:\n\n1. What writing are you working on?\n2. When do you hope to have it finished by?\n3. What are your next steps?\n\n--------------------------\n\n--- My plan is to create a mastermind group or potentially several mastermind groups could sprout from this meetup (and repeat meetups like it). ---\n\nAlthough this is meetup is not a mastermind group itself, but a pre-cursor to meeting other writers..\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe word “mastermind” was coined by Napoleon Hill in the 1920s. Hill believed that when two people come together to solve a problem, their combined wisdom forms a “mastermind.”\n\nHe urged budding entrepreneurs to form mastermind groups (or “alliances”, as he called them) where they could keep each other accountable to their goals and give each other advice about their projects.\n\nThe Inklings is one of the best-known mastermind groups formed by writers. Headed by C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, the group gathered on Thursday evenings at Lewis’s rooms in Magdalen College. Later on, they would also meet for lunch at a local Oxford pub called The Eagle and Child.\n\nThe members of the group came together to share ideas and receive feedback on the latest drafts of their novels. Tolkien, for example, read aloud from a manuscript that would eventually become The Lord of the Rings.",

We will be exploring various methods of generating ideas and tapping into your creativity. The tools used will include freewriting, visual prompts, randomizers (i.e. story cubes) and more.\n\nThroughout the day, the activities will build on each other so that when you leave you should have plenty of material to work with on your own if you wish. You will also have lots of new tricks and strategies that you can use in the future if you get creatively stuck or are searching for new ideas.\n\nThis workshop is perfect for anyone who is looking to start a new project, is battling writers block, or simply wants to explore their creative side (you don't have to be an experienced writer to join! beginners are more than welcome!)\n\nCome with a notebook, pen, computer, whatever you prefer to write with -- and a willingness to play and explore!\n\nSpaces are limited so please only RSVP if you can make it. If something comes up, no prob! Just change your RSVP so someone else can have your space.\n\nWe will be in the function room in the back of Artisan Coffee in Ealing Broadway.",

        "eventUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/the-writers-initiative/events/269640864",
        "description": "One of the key aspects of fiction writing is developing and using an adept style of writing. There are many elements that go towards this, but for this meet-up, we will concentrate on:- 'Show, Don't Tell' and 'Evocation.'\n\nThis session will delve into these key elements that go towards an effective writing style.\n\n-----------------\n\nNOTE: This will be an interactive session sitting around a table. So you will discuss and engage with other members of the meeting.\n\nThis session suits both new or experienced writers who are looking for a refresh or discussion on these topics.\n\n------------------\n\nAGENDA: (7 pm to 8.30 pm).\n\n1. Show, Don't Tell (Detail/Specifics).\n2. Evocation (Evoking emotions).\n3. Cultivation of a Paragraph (bringing your own example).\n\n1. SHOW, DON' TELL:\n\nOne of the most commonly discussed aspects of writing style. We will discuss this and then try some examples. Starting with some basic 'tell' sentences and then developing them to see how they can be improved.\n\nIn this session, there will be around four or more sentences that will be given to the group for jumping off points. Some time will be allowed for the group to chat and come up with suggestions for how the sentence(s) can be developed.\n\nE.G.\n\n- 'John walks down the street to his grandmother's house.'\n\nNothing wrong with the above sentence, but it may not be engaging with the reader.\n\nInstead, try writing:\n\n- 'Every step was like walking through mud, as sweat rolled down his cheeks and an impending feeling of doom saturated John’s mind, for he knew that soon he will be at his grandmother’s house.'\n\n2. EVOCATION:\n\nEvoking emotions. This is a sure fire way to engage with your audience. There are many ways to do this and (perhaps worryingly at times) newspapers or websites often do this with great effect even though they are not writing fiction.\n\nCreating an impulsive or engaging feeling that draws in the reader. This can be subtle or have a great effect.\n\nWe will discuss examples and ways of how to do this. Ways to do this could be show injustice, love, vengeance... etc..\n\nWe will also create a paragraph and use that to evoke emotions.\n\n3. YOUR PARAGRAPH:\n\nAs part of this meet-up please prepare a paragraph on any subject you wish. (I will bring along one to discuss as well).\n\nThen bring this to the meet-up and at the end of the workshop as a group we will look at this paragraph and discuss how (if possible) it can be built upon.\n\nYou don't need to print this out and can just read it out from your phone or laptop.\n\n-----------------\n\nOther Details:\n\n1. This meetup will be held online and I will share the link nearer to the workshop time.\n\n2. The meetup will be held using a video service called Whereby.\n\n3. I will share handouts via google docs at the start of the meeting - but I will need an email address to share these.",

E.g. It will be – www.mysite.wordpress.com instead of www.mysite.com.\n\n---------------------\n\nIt goes without saying that in the modern-day world a huge amount of communication and information is provided from the internet and accessed through mobile devices and desktop PCs.\n\nBy staking a space for yourself online you are creating a central point for where you can share and display your work. And also where you can promote your work and potentially build a community.\n\nThis will be a short 2-hour course and by the end of it, you will have a WordPress.com website and will have the basic knowledge to be able to go on and build similar Wordpress.com sites.\n\n------------------\nAgenda:\n\n1. Introduction:\n1.1 The difference between WordPress.com and Wordpress.org\n1.2 Creating a clear vision for your website.\n1.3 Listing the key requirements and prioritising.\n\n2. Sourcing design assets and images.\n\n3. Stage 1:\n3.1 Setting up the site.\n3.2 Choosing a template to start with.\n\n4. Stage 2:\n4.1 Initial configuration.\n4.2 Adding pages.\n4.3 Adding posts.\n4.4 Adding a Menu and Customisation.\n\n5. An Agile approach: Don’t aim to be perfect! Some of the best feedback you’ll get is when the site is live.\n\n------------------\n\nAny questions please ask.\n\n(The course will be held by Chris Mitchell who has worked in technology and project management roles for over 10 years and who has built numerous websites, both large and small.)",

        "description": "This will be our first in-person (and SOCIALLY DISTANCED) creative writing workshop since you-know-when, perfect for anyone who's longing to shake off those lockdown cobwebs and let their imaginations run free.\n\nThis writing workshop will consist of various exercises and prompts intended to help you generate new ideas and tap into your creativity. You don't need to have anything you're already working on (though if you do, also cool), and you don't have to share your work with the group if you don't want to. Writers of all levels of experience are welcome (and If you've attended before, note that there will be no repeat exercises: all fresh material here!)\n\nThroughout the session, the activities will build on each other so that when you leave you should have plenty of material to work with on your own if you wish. You will also have lots of new tricks and strategies that you can use in the future if you get creatively stuck or are searching for new ideas. This workshop is perfect for anyone who is looking to start a new project, is battling writer's block, or simply wants to explore their creative side (beginners are more than welcome!).\n\nCome with a notebook, pen, computer (bearing in mind that we will be outdoors), whatever you prefer to write with -- and a willingness to play and explore!\n\nArrive at 2pm for a 2:15ish start. We will be meeting by the gazebo in Walpole Park (which is near the cafe and near-ish the pond). Bring something to sit on if you wish (i.e. pillow or blanket as we will be on the ground). We will have hand sanitiser, but bring your own if you can!\n\nThere are no refunds available for this event, but if something happens on the day please get in touch, we may be able to give you a place on a different workshop at a later date.\n\nAgain, we will be VERY STRICT ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING at this event. Masks are optional as we will be outdoors, but please maintain the recommended distance as much as possible.\n\nSee you then!!",

Some time will be allowed for the group to chat and come up with suggestions for how the sentence(s) can be developed.\n\nE.G.\n\n- 'John walks down the street to his grandmother's house.'\n\nNothing wrong with the above sentence, but it may not be engaging with the reader.\n\nInstead, try writing:\n\n- 'Every step was like walking through mud, as sweat rolled down his cheeks and an impending feeling of doom saturated John’s mind, for he knew that soon he will be at his grandmother’s house.'\n\n2. EVOCATION:\n\nEvoking emotions. This is a sure-fire way to engage with your audience. There are many ways to do this and (perhaps worryingly at times) newspapers or websites often do this with great effect even though they are not writing fiction.\n\nCreating an impulsive or engaging feeling that draws in the reader.

Ways to do this could be show injustice, love, vengeance... etc..\n\nWe will also create a paragraph and use that to evoke emotions.\n\n3.

        "eventUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/the-writers-initiative/events/273092017",
        "description": "In the workshop, we will discuss ideas, structure and plot points that relate to classic victorian ghost stories and in particular those of M.R.James.\n\nThe aim will be for you to learn how to write in a Jamesian style and if you wish in your own time to proceed and write a short ghost story.\n\nIf you already have a lot of experience in this genre, please still feel to join and share your knowledge.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. A short introduction to the Jamesian style.\n\n2. Before delving further into ghost stories a short look at ways to make your writing suspenseful:\n\n2.1 Limit the POV.\n2.2 Style and form.\n2.3 Dramatic irony.\n\nThen the body of the meetup will be for all to discuss and come up with ideas following the points below - for your own ghost stories.\n\nParticipants will be encouraged to engage in the discussion, so please feel free to add your thoughts and questions.\n\n3. The Jamesian Style:\n3.1 Location and setting.\n3.2 The main protagonist.\n3.3 An object.\n\nI will bring some specific examples of characters and settings from some of James stories.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTo create the perfect Jamesian ghost story you will need the ingredients below:\n\n1. A quaint, ancient setting. Such as a twee English country village, an estranged seaside town or a stately Abbey. James loved to utilise the antiquity of a colourful setting with an isolated atmosphere.\n\n2. A lady or gentleman protagonist. Many of James’ characters are naive reserved scholars, who are often not convinced something strange is happening until the final climax of the story.\n\n3. A pivotal antiquarian object. Whether an old book or an antique, the discovery of a mystery object that unlocks and attracts an unwelcome figure from beyond the grave is a signature mark of James’ stories.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe story that you produce will be after the meetup, will be at your own pace and in your own time, but it would be great to see your short stories if you wish to share them.\n\n-------------------------\n\nJames was a lecturer at Cambridge University and at Christmas time he became well known for reading back his ghost stories.\n\nHe was master of the uncanny, the purveyor of the uncomfortable and a writer renowned for his atmospheric ghostly tales. It was also in Victorian times a tradition to tell ghost stories and one of the most famous ghost stories of all time was set in the Christmas period - that, of course, being \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens.\n\nJameson ghost storytelling was straight down the line and revolved around the idea of real ghosts, not psychological illusions or paranoid affects of the human mind. So if you prefer writing psychological type ghost or horror stories then this workshop may not be for you.\n\n- Just to note - although Jame's stories were published in the Edwardian period, he wrote and shared them primarily during at the end of the Victorian period.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThe writer M.R. James once said: “Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo.… Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.”\n\n-------------------------\n\n1. This meetup will be held online and I will share the link nearer to the workshop time directly with those that sign up. I will most likely be using https://jitsi.org/ or Google Meet.\n\nFYI - Jitsi is a super easy to use video conference tool and does not require an account to use.\n\n2. There are no refunds available for this event, but if you can't make it on the day please get in touch, we may well be able to give you a place on a different workshop at a later date.",

        "description": "A story is so much more than Plot and Things That Happen.\n\nA story is first and foremost about character and WHY the events of the plot matter to them.\n\nThis fun and highly informative creative writing workshop will seek to dispel common creative writing myths and help you to understand not only WHY you need to know your story's emotional arc, but HOW to go about achieving this and weaving emotional significance into every step of your story.\n\nHaving a solid emotional arc is essential for so many reasons: (1) It keeps readers hooked because they want to find out WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, (2) It makes YOU a better writer because you will know your characters intimately, making it less likely that you will lose steam or come up against the dreaded writers block, and (3) It means that your story will flow organically and naturally from start to finish, leading to a seamless and deeply satisfying end product.\n\nWe will start by thoroughly exploring what emotional arc means and why your story needs an emotional core. We will then guide you through the experience of building your story's emotional arc, and you will leave the workshop with a toolbox of tips, tricks, and exercises that you will be able to use again whenever you need.\n\nThis workshop is perfect for writers of all levels of experience, and it may be especially useful for those of you who are taking on NaNoWriMo!

        "description": "It was a Victorian tradition to tell ghost stories at Christmas time - A tradition that has now (unfortunately) faded away. There is nothing more entertaining than a good ghost story told around a crackling fire or cosy living room.\n\nHopefully, this workshop will inspire you to write and tell a few of your own ghost stories. - Around Christmas time.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nIn the workshop, we will discuss ideas, structure and plot points that relate to classic Victorian ghost stories and in particular those of M.R.James.\n\nIf you have a lot of experience in this genre, please still feel to join and share your knowledge.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. A short introduction to the Jamesian style.\n\n2. Before delving further into ghost stories a short look at ways to make your writing suspenseful:\n\n2.1 Limit the POV.\n2.2 Style and form.\n2.3 Dramatic irony.\n\nThen the body of the meetup will be for all to discuss and come up with ideas following the points below - for your own ghost stories.\n\nParticipants will be encouraged to engage in the discussion, so please feel free to add your thoughts and questions.\n\n3. The Jamesian Style:\n3.1 Location and setting.\n3.2 The main protagonist.\n3.3 An object.\n\nI will bring some specific examples of characters and settings from some of James stories.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTo create the perfect Jamesian ghost story you will need:\n\n1. A quaint, ancient setting. Such as a twee English country village, an estranged seaside town or a stately Abbey. James loved to utilise the antiquity of a colourful setting with an isolated atmosphere.\n\n2. A lady or gentleman protagonist. Many of James’ characters are naive reserved scholars, who are often not convinced something strange is happening until the final climax of the story.\n\n3. A pivotal antiquarian object. Whether an old book or an antique, the discovery of a mystery object that unlocks and attracts an unwelcome figure from beyond the grave is a signature mark of James’ stories.\n\n-------------------------\n\nJames was a lecturer at Cambridge University and at Christmas time he became well known for reading back his ghost stories.\n\nHe was master of the uncanny, the purveyor of the uncomfortable and a writer renowned for his atmospheric ghostly tales. It was also in Victorian times a tradition to tell ghost stories and one of the most famous ghost stories of all time was set in the Christmas period - that, of course, being \"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens.\n\nJameson ghost storytelling was straight down the line and revolved around the idea of real ghosts, not psychological illusions or paranoid affects of the human mind. So if you prefer writing psychological type ghost or horror stories then this workshop may not be for you.\n\n- Just to note - although Jame's stories were published in the Edwardian period, he wrote and shared them primarily during at the end of the Victorian period.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThe writer M.R. James once said: “Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo.… Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.”\n\n-------------------------\n\n1. This meetup will be held online and I will share the link nearer to the workshop time directly with those that sign up. I will be using https://jitsi.org/ or Google Meet.\n\n2. There are no refunds available for this event, but if you can't make it on the day please get in touch, we may well be able to give you a place on a different workshop at a later date.",

These workshops will help you to hone your creative wordsmithing skills as well as increase your understanding of what makes good writing and how to achieve it.\n\nIn this deep dive workshop, we will look at THREE-ACT STRUCTURE -- in other words, what a story needs in its beginning, middle, and end. We will go deep into the conventions here and also look at some examples of successful three-act structure in storytelling. We will demystify these rules of thumb as well as empower you to know when to break them, drawing from examples of writing that subverts, flaunts, or otherwise ignores the typical structure.\n\nIn addition to the information and examples provided, you can expect a number of practical prompts and exercises that will help you to become better acquainted with three-act structure so that you will be able to skillfully apply these techniques to your own projects. This highly informative and fun workshop will leave you with the understanding and the confidence to structure your own writing in a way that makes your story compelling, organic, and satisfying to an audience.\n\nThis workshop is perfect for writers of all levels of experience.

The sessions will begin at 7pm (no later), so this will give you plenty of time to find us and get yourself a drink at the bar.\n\nIn the first session there will be a FREE Penguin book for each person to take home and keep. In subsequent sessions, you’ll receive handouts, with guidance and pointers to help you improve your writing. In each session, we'll also provide some free snacks. This will help you enjoy your drink (and your writing) just that little bit more!\n\nWe’ll work together on character, perspective, tone, and dialogue, and instead of using a rigid plot structure, we’ll be using methods that encourage spontaneity.\n\nBy the end of the three weeks, you ought to have a fair amount written. We'll even invite you to publish all or part of it in our online journal (though, of course, you won't have to if you don't want to!).\n\n.....\n\nIf you want to make new friends, this event is for you.\n\nIf you want to make forays into a new, serious piece of writing, this event is for you.\n\nIf you want to have a beer or a glass of wine (during/after each session) and surprise yourself doing something fun and spontaneous, this event is for you!\n\n***THE GROUP IS FOR EVERYBODY FROM COMPLETE BEGINNERS TO SEASONED PROFESSIONALS. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANY PRESSURE TO READ YOUR WORK IN FRONT OF THE OTHER PEOPLE THERE***\n\nAny questions, please don't hesitate to text or WhatsApp us on 07534 981 636.\n\nCan't wait to see you soon.\n\nCheers!\n\nSean\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: there is officially a no refund policy for this event.

        "description": "This is a special, SURREAL edition of the All Day Sesh!\n\nSurrealism is the most dramatic and thrilling of the modernist cultural movements of the 20s and 30s. It is best known for its dream-like visual artworks, but it’s writings are also magnificent, marked by strange juxtapositions, tangential ramblings, partial or broken meanings and oblique allusions to political or emotional states.\n\nTo work in the surrealist mode is to dream big, to unearth the most exciting and hidden elements of the unconscious, to access hitherto latent parts of what feels like a foreign part of the psyché.\n\nFor this special edition of the All Day Sesh! will be looking at parts of the surrealist manifesto by Andre Breton, some poems by Paul Eluard, some surrealist prose fiction, and examples of surrealism in contemporary writing. You will also have the opportunity to try surrealist writing for yourself!\n\n“Surrealism is destructive” said Salvador Dali, “but it destroys only what it considers to be shackles limiting our vision.”\n\nCome and join us and experience the mesmerising power of surrealist writing, first hand. Produce your own surrealist work. Take a leap into the unknown. Emerge changed and fascinate!\n\n***NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. ALL WILL BE REVEALED***\n\nThis event includes:\n\n1 x two-hour workshop (on SURREALISM IN LITERATURE)\n1 x free book\n1 x free breakfast\n1 x free tea or coffee\n3 x 40-minute writing sessions (with breaks in between)\n1 x free early evening drink\n1 x bunch of new writing buddies!\n\nAs always, this is a group for writers and non-writers, alike. No experience necessary. If you're already writing a novel - great! If you've never written anything in your life - that's also great!\n\n...\n\nMeet us at 10:45am at Finch's Pub in Old Street for a free breakfast.\n\nWhen we've had our breakfast and we're sipping tea or coffee, we’ll have a 2 hour workshop on SURREALISM IN LITERATURE.\n\nAt 1:30pm, we’ll sit down and have 3 x 40-minute writing sessions, using the Pomodorro technique (this means you'll get a 15-minute break between each stint of writing, and a chance to relax and confer with others, or whatever it is you feel like doing).\n\n*Note: there may be a tiny bit of background noise, but we’ll provide earplugs for you. Please bring your own headphones, if you’d prefer to use these.\n\nTo finish the day off, we'll go together for a FREE, early-evening drink in a bar (also very nearby).\n\nYou'll be more than welcome to have the one drink, or to sit and have another couple with the crew, for as long as people want to stay.\n\n...\n\nThis is a full day event (11am — 6pm, approx.)\n\n15 people, max.\n\nYou will never have to read your work in front of the group!\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: there is officially a no refund policy for this event. However, if you cancel a number of days in advance and we're able to refill your space, we will indeed refund you. Similarly, moving a cancelled RSVP over to a future event is contingent upon being able to refill the space that you vacate.",

You can use these writing sessions to work on your own thing, in your own time.\n\nAt the end of the day, we'll invite you to stay for a drink with the crew, to celebrate (though this is not compulsory).\n\nYou'll be more than welcome to just have the one drink, or to sit and have another couple with the crew, for as long as people want to stay.\n\n...\n\nIncluded in this event is:\n\n1 x two-hour workshop\n1 x free book\n1 x free breakfast\n3 x 40-minute writing sessions (with 15-minute breaks in between)\n1 x bunch of new writing buddies!\n\nThis is a full day event (11am — 6pm, approx.)\n\nYou will never have to read your work in front of the group!\n\n***PLEASE NOTE: there is officially a no refund policy for this event.

Then we’ll be using some playful writing prompts to get you writing in your own style.\n\nFor one night, forget the Queen’s grammar, forget Oxford syntax… be free to ramble away in the unique cadence of your own voice.\n\nYou will never be pressured to read your work aloud to the group, and you are not expected to have any knowledge of any particular dialect or slang.\n\nAs William Faulkner once said: “Write what you know”.\n\nIndeed: write what you know in the only voice you’ve ever known it: your own.\n\nIf you’d like to come to this workshop, you’ll receive:\n\n1 x free book\n1 x 2-hour workshop on slang and dialect in creative writing\n1 x free snacks\n1 x handout\n\n+ the invitation to stick around for an evening drink afterwards, to celebrate everything you’ve achieved.\n\nAs always please text or WhatsApp us on 07534 981 636 if you have any questions about this event (or any other), or if you would like to be added to our WhatsApp community for updates.\n\nDon’t be shy—we’d love to hear from you!\n\nCheers.\n\nSean :)",

EVER***.\n\nAttendees will arrive at 10:45am, to begin at 11am. Here, we will take your breakfast + tea or coffee order. Then after breakfast, we will guide you through a series of playful creative writing exercises, so that you can begin to formulate your own ideas, in your own unique style.\n\nAfter breakfast and our 2-hour writing workshop, we will have a lunch break. After this, author Luke Tredget will arrive and we will reconvene for a friendly Q&A with him (*Note: don't worry. You won't be expected to ask questions or have anything to say. If nobody has any questions, you can just listen to Luke and your workshop host, Sean, in conversation about Luke's novel, Kismet, and about everything to do with publication, from writing approaches and style to finding an agent, sending off a manuscript and seeing your name in print).\n\nLuke has agreed that he will sign a free copy of his book for you, to take away and keep!\n\nIf you have any questions about this event (or any other), please don't hesitate to text or WhatsApp us on 07534 981 636 - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nWe hope to see you there for this incredible opportunity.\n\nUntil then...\n\nCheers! :)\n\n...........................................\n\nPraise for Luke's novel:\n\n\"Sharp, witty and full of tension...an intelligent and highly readable novel.\"―Irish Times\n\n\"Tredget's trenchant, entertaining debut traces how big data and social media have become an obstacle for healthy relationships...An incisive view of the uncertainties of contemporary adulthood.\"―Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Kismet is compelling for more than its unflinching study of the infiltration of romance by technology and algorithms. At its heart this novel is about what endures in spite of all that; a modern love story of exceptional warmth, intelligence and humanity.\"―Luke Kennard, author of The Transition\n\n\"Tredget writes a funny, timely story, with flawed and relatable characters, about how technology affects our desires and what it means to 'settle.' Though he satirizes modern dating and the idea of perfection in a relationship, he writes with an engaging warmth and lightness. Readers will surely enjoy this witty modern love story.\"―Booklist",

The main person you have to trick into confidence is yourself. This is hard to do alone\". – Zadie Smith***\n\n...\nLet's get together and learn how to write the perfect beginning.\n\nWhether you've already written your novel/short story or you're starting something afresh, this is the perfect workshop to hone your style, tone, tempo, and general approach.\n\nWe'll be looking at everybody from Zadie Smith to John Cheever, Francois Sagan to Katherine Mansfield, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie to Jorge Luis Borges.\n\nWe'll be looking at what agents and publishers might want from the opening chapter.\n\nWe'll be setting you up with some fun, exciting writing exercises, to make sure you get the chance to finesse your approach and leave with something new and brilliant, ready to take home and edit.\n\nFirst of all though, we'll be ordering teas, coffees and brunch, before we settle in for a warm-up exercise, to get our imaginations flowing.\n\nNo experience of writing is necessary for this workshop.\n\nNo pressure to read or share your work with the group.\n\nJust sit back, listen, learn, read, write, eat, drink, and come away full of new knowledge and expertise in the art of writing.\n\n***\"The scariest moment is always just before you start\". – Stephen King***\n\nSo please feel free to text us on 07534 981 636 if you have any questions at all - we'll be more happy to help :)",

Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. You will never have to read your work in front of the group – it will merely be discussed by the group in a friendly, constructive manner (a manner consistent with a blueprint for critique that I will set out in week 3). Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

        "description": "The full price for this course is £60 (super early-bird price = £50). That's equivalent to £12 (or cheaper) for each two-hour session (+ at the end of the 5 weeks, you will have the opportunity to PUBLISH YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE.\n\nIf you would like to do this course online, please contact the organiser first.\n\n...\n\nPod No. 1 (beginners) 5-week short story course\n\n[There will only be 6 places in a Pod. Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

Things like:\n\n• Line breaks\n\n• Stanza formation\n\n• Rhythm\n\n• Free verse\n\nBy the end of the day, you'll have a small handful of your own poems, either complete or to take home and work on.\n\nIf you're an intermediate level poet, this workshop will also be enormously beneficial to you. We'll be generating ideas together and you'll have the fixed structure of the day to compel your progress!\n\nAny questions, don't hesitate to ask (either reply here or text Sean on: 07534 981 636).\n\nHope to see you soon! :)",

At the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH PART OF YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nPOD-101: “THE ADVANCED COURSE”\n\nThe aim of this course is for you to plan and write a novel.\n\nWeek 1. (Planning your novel)\n\nIn the first week, you’ll be generating an idea for your novel. You will then flesh-out/develop this idea using a narrative arc. This arc will ensure that you’re able to produce a compelling and dynamic story for whomever your readership is intended to be. You can take the arc home, develop and/or discard it, depending on your personal preference. Either way, the arc is an essential aspect of good storytelling, and the strategy you receive here will benefit your writing immensely.\n\nWeek 2. (Narrative Perspective + Chapters 1 & 2)\n\nIn the second week, you’ll be invited to plan your first two chapters, in greater depth. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will help you decide which narrative perspective (and which tense) to write your novel in.\n\nWeek 3. (Dialogue + Chapters 3, 4 & 5)\n\nIn the third week, you’ll be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will ensure you’re using dialogue effectively in your work.\n\nWeek 4. (Feedback + Chapters 6, 7 & 8)\n\nIn the fourth week, you will receive feedback for up to 3000 words of the writing you have done so far. You will also be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters.\n\nWeek 5. (Feedback + Chapters 9 & 10 + Re-visiting the arc)\n\nIn the final week, you will plan and/or write your 9th & 10th chapter. You will also re-visit the narrative arc you made for your work at the beginning of the course. This will enable you to consolidate a final first draft or plan for your entire novel.\n\n***Note: your novel may not be precisely 10 chapters. This is, of course, entirely up to you. POD-101/THE ADVANCED COURSE is here to provide you a 5-week structure within which to complete as much of your novel as possible. If you’re extremely motivated, you may finish an entire first draft. Most people, however, will produce an entire plan/outline + only *some* of their first draft. Either way, POD-101 will be running on a rolling basis. So you will have the opportunity to RSVP again for the next 5-weeks, and continue working on your novel. To avoid the workshop becoming stale and un-productive, participants should not sign up for more than two consecutive POD-101’s.\n\nIf you would like to do this course, but you have some questions, please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.",

I will be giving us a timed 45 minute window, followed by a 15 minute break, to ensure progress. You can chat to each other during the breaks, but it would be great to stick to writing for the time allotted to it, so that we don't distract each other.\n\nI hope to see lots of you there!\n\nAll the best,\n\nSean",

Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

        "description": "The full price for this course is £60. That's equivalent to £12 for each two-hour session (+ you will have multiple opportunities to receive feedback on your work. At the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH PART OF YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nPOD-101: “THE ADVANCED COURSE”\n\nThe aim of this course is for you to plan and write a novel.\n\nWeek 1. (Planning your novel)\n\nIn the first week, you’ll be generating an idea for your novel. You will then flesh-out/develop this idea using a narrative arc. This arc will ensure that you’re able to produce a compelling and dynamic story for whomever your readership is intended to be. You can take the arc home, develop and/or discard it, depending on your personal preference. Either way, the arc is an essential aspect of good storytelling, and the strategy you receive here will benefit your writing immensely.\n\nWeek 2. (Narrative Perspective + Chapters 1 & 2)\n\nIn the second week, you’ll be invited to plan your first two chapters, in greater depth. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will help you decide which narrative perspective (and which tense) to write your novel in.\n\nWeek 3. (Dialogue + Chapters 3, 4 & 5)\n\nIn the third week, you’ll be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will ensure you’re using dialogue effectively in your work.\n\nWeek 4. (Feedback + Chapters 6, 7 & 8)\n\nIn the fourth week, you will receive feedback for up to 3000 words of the writing you have done so far. You will also be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters.\n\nWeek 5. (Feedback + Chapters 9 & 10 + Re-visiting the arc)\n\nIn the final week, you will plan and/or write your 9th & 10th chapter. You will also re-visit the narrative arc you made for your work at the beginning of the course. This will enable you to consolidate a final first draft or plan for your entire novel.\n\n***Note: your novel may not be precisely 10 chapters. This is, of course, entirely up to you. POD-101/THE ADVANCED COURSE is here to provide you a 5-week structure within which to complete as much of your novel as possible. If you’re extremely motivated, you may finish an entire first draft. Most people, however, will produce an entire plan/outline + only *some* of their first draft. Either way, POD-101 will be running on a rolling basis. So you will have the opportunity to RSVP again for the next 5-weeks, and continue working on your novel. To avoid the workshop becoming stale and un-productive, participants should not sign up for more than two consecutive POD-101’s.\n\nIf you would like to do this course, but you have some questions, please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.",

That's equivalent to £12 (but only £10, this time) for each two-hour session (+ you will have multiple opportunities to receive feedback on your work and, at the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nIf you would like to do this course online, it's ONLY £40!!! But please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.\n\n**********\n\nTHIS COURSE WILL HAVE A BREAK OVER XMAS. SO THE DATES OF THE SESSIONS WILL BE: 7th Dec, 14th Dec, 21st Dec---BREAK---4th Jan, 11th Jan.\n\n**********\n\n...\n\nPod No. 1 (beginners/intermediate) 5-week short story course\n\n[There will only be 6 places in a Pod. Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

        "description": "The full price for this course is £60. That's equivalent to £12 for each two-hour session (+ you will have multiple opportunities to receive feedback on your work. At the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH PART OF YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nPOD-101: “THE ADVANCED COURSE”\n\nThe aim of this course is for you to plan and write a novel.\n\nWeek 1. (Planning your novel)\n\nIn the first week, you’ll be generating an idea for your novel. You will then flesh-out/develop this idea using a narrative arc. This arc will ensure that you’re able to produce a compelling and dynamic story for whomever your readership is intended to be. You can take the arc home, develop and/or discard it, depending on your personal preference. Either way, the arc is an essential aspect of good storytelling, and the strategy you receive here will benefit your writing immensely.\n\nWeek 2. (Narrative Perspective + Chapters 1 & 2)\n\nIn the second week, you’ll be invited to plan your first two chapters, in greater depth. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will help you decide which narrative perspective (and which tense) to write your novel in.\n\nWeek 3. (Dialogue + Chapters 3, 4 & 5)\n\nIn the third week, you’ll be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters. You will also partake in a creative writing exercise that will ensure you’re using dialogue effectively in your work.\n\nWeek 4. (Feedback + Chapters 6, 7 & 8)\n\nIn the fourth week, you will receive feedback for up to 3000 words of the writing you have done so far. You will also be invited to plan and/or write your next three chapters.\n\nWeek 5. (Feedback + Chapters 9 & 10 + Re-visiting the arc)\n\nIn the final week, you will plan and/or write your 9th & 10th chapter. You will also re-visit the narrative arc you made for your work at the beginning of the course. This will enable you to consolidate a final first draft or plan for your entire novel.\n\n***Note: your novel may not be precisely 10 chapters. This is, of course, entirely up to you. POD-101/THE ADVANCED COURSE is here to provide you a 5-week structure within which to complete as much of your novel as possible. If you’re extremely motivated, you may finish an entire first draft. Most people, however, will produce an entire plan/outline + only *some* of their first draft. Either way, POD-101 will be running on a rolling basis. So you will have the opportunity to RSVP again for the next 5-weeks, and continue working on your novel. To avoid the workshop becoming stale and un-productive, participants should not sign up for more than two consecutive POD-101’s.\n\nIf you would like to do this course, but you have some questions, please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.",

That's equivalent to £12 (but only £10, this time) for each two-hour session (+ you will have multiple opportunities to receive feedback on your work and, at the end of the 5 weeks, you will also have the opportunity to PUBLISH YOUR WORK and receive ongoing feedback on The New Machine's website, for FREE).\n\nIf you would like to do this course online, it's ONLY £40!!! But please contact the organiser first, by texting 07534 981 636.\n\n**********\n\nTHIS COURSE WILL HAVE A BREAK OVER XMAS. SO THE DATES OF THE SESSIONS WILL BE: 7th Dec, 14th Dec, 21st Dec---BREAK---4th Jan, 11th Jan.\n\n**********\n\n...\n\nPod No. 1 (beginners/intermediate) 5-week short story course\n\n[There will only be 6 places in a Pod. Regular creative writing classes consist of between 10 – 15 people. A 6-person pod ensures you will each receive closer attention to the details of your work. Each session will last for approx. 2 hours + there will be a very short piece of homework, designed to ensure that you’re progressing nicely throughout the course. By the end of the 5th week you will have produced a final edit of a short story you’ve been working on and have the opportunity to publish it on the New Machine’s website]\n\nWeek 1 - Point of view\n\nWe will be looking here at the relationship between the reader and the narrator. You will learn what it means to write in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person (+ variations). I will introduce you to some the textual nuances that authors deploy within these narrative modes. You’ll then have an opportunity to explore this yourself, in writing.\n\nIn this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Brett Easton Ellis, Chimamanda Ngoze Adichie, Elizabeth Gaskell and JM Coetzee.\n\nWeek 2 - Style/tone and dialogue\n\nIn the second week, we will examine three different narrative styles. You will have an opportunity to emulate these in a writing exercise. We will then discuss dialogue and explore this using a free writing technique. In this session we will be looking at excerpts from: Charles Dickens, Katherine Mansfield and Albert Camus.\n\nWeek 3 – Character development and plot\n\nThis session will help you generate ideas for characters and plot. You will be begin to see your own short story emerging.\n\nThe homework will be to write a 2000-word short story based on everything you’ve learned so far.\n\nWeek 4 - How to critique\n\nWe will look at a short story here together and learn how to critique it in terms of its themes, its character development(s), its style/type of narration, its plot and structure, its dialogue, etc. You will learn to distinguish what you think is effective and what needs work in other peoples’ writing (this will in turn inform your own writing and allow you to proceed with more clarity).\n\nWeek 5 - Feedback\n\nHere you will receive a compassionate critique of your work, and will partake in a discussion of other peoples’ work (+ you will have an opportunity to take your story away with you, produce a final edit, and publish it on The New Machine’s website).",

We'll be generating ideas together and you'll have the fixed structure of the day to compel your progress!\n\nAny questions, don't hesitate to ask (either reply here or text Sean on: 07534 981 636).\n\nHope to see you soon! :)",

For those unfamiliar with the pub, it's at 12 Seymour Place, right around the corner from Marble Arch tube station.\n\nFor a map, click here (https://www.allinlondon.co.uk/mapping/map.php?pc=W1H+7NE)\n\nWe'll be rolling in from 7pm, but things probably won't get going till 7.30 or 8, depending on turn-out. Still, get in early for nibbles and contraband shop-bought red wine! The Writer's Group is upstairs, so just navigate your way through the hoardes of rowdy public servants propping up the bar, up the trecherous staircase, through the dank, unlit corridors to our glorious creative sanctuary!\n\nThe topic for our inaugural 2008 meet-up is \"Secrets\". So think of a short story, poem, performance piece or anything else that fits the topic. Note, for first-timers, the topic is applied very loosely!\n\nIt could be about secret pasts, secret lovers, or a yearning paean to the discontinuation of the Cadbury Secret bar. There's no word limit, so just bring whatever you're comfortable with sharing.\n\nWe normally read out our own work, but if you'd rather remain anonymous, get in touch with me directly through Meetup.com and I'll arrange to have one of our many fine public-speakers read it out for you.\n\nAny questions, please email me: guy *underscore* kerr *at* hotmail.com (email removed due to swarms of Burkina Faso bankers offering millions)\n\nCheers and hope to see you all there!\n\nGuy",

We've had some dramas with our favourite pub, The Carpenters Arms, which is no longer our little secret and has been booked out by all kinds of wacky groups (London Chess Society, anyone?).\n\nSo....we've moved our meet up night to Tuesday, 29th April. Hopefully the proximity to the start of the working week won't dissuade our staunch squadron of writers from attending! And it's still at our favourite little not-so-underground-anymore pub, The Carpenters Arms. 12 Seymour Place, a stone's throw from Marble Arch tube and Oxford Street Primark. Click here for a map (https://www.allinlondon.co.uk/mapping/map.php?pc=W1H+7NE)\n\nThe theme this time around is Climbing. Could be Social Climbing, Mountain Climbing, Climbing Plants, or just the eternal struggle to climb from one's bed each morning! Please note, the topic is applied very loosely and is just a guide! Your writing can come in many forms, poem, short story, puppet show, up to you! Please try to keep it to under 10 minutes in length, unless you're really good :)\n\nThe official start time is 8, but I'll be there just after 7 preparing everything. The Writer's Group is upstairs, so just navigate your way through the hoardes of rowdy public servants propping up the bar, up the trecherous staircase, through the dank, unlit corridors to our glorious creative sanctuary!\n\nOnce again, any questions, please email me: guy *underscore* kerr *at* hotmail.com.

From the poll (https://www.meetup.com/londonwriterscafe/polls/164322/), there is equal interest in both.\n\nSecond, there will be no set themes for the readings. I see the primary aim of the group as helping people with their existing work, so priority will be given to those who want feedback on a live project they are working on. Although I'll post a suggested theme each month, this is only for those who are not working on something of their own, and those readings will take a lower priority (ie. we'll come onto them if we have time).\n\nThe suggested theme, as befits a new year, is 'new beginnings'. But please, if you are working on something of your own, bring that instead.\n\nThe format will be time slots of 15 minutes, which are yours to use as you please. For example, you could do a 5-minute reading and have time for 10 minutes of feedback, or present a plot problem in 2 minutes and have 13 minutes of suggestions. It's entirely up to you, but remember that the more of your time you spend talking, the less time there is left for feedback and input!\n\nThe group will run for 2.5 hours, which will allow 10 time-slots. If more than 10 people request a slot, priority is given to those who want input on their own work. If there are more than 10 of those, names will be picked out of a hat (metaphorically speaking; I don't actually own a hat ...).\n\nPayment by Paypal must be made when you RSVP. Funds are used for meetup fees, with any balance going into a pool to buy drinks for the assistant organisers.\n\nThis first meeting will run from 7.30-10pm to allow time for the volunteer co-organisers to meet beforehand; future meetings will run from 7-9.30pm.\n\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line:\nhttps://www.pubandbar-...

        "description": "The London Writers Cafe is a chance to either get feedback on a short piece of writing, or to describe a challenge you are facing (plot difficulties, writers' block, etc) and get suggestions on that.\n\nThere are no set themes for the readings as the primary aim of the group is helping people with their existing work. Priority will thus be given to those who want feedback on a live project. Although I'll post a suggested theme each month, this is only for those who are not working on something of their own, and those readings will take a lower priority (ie. we'll come onto them if we have time).\n\nThe suggested theme for March is 'Memories'. But please, if you are working on something of your own, bring that instead.\n\nThe format is time slots of 20 minutes, which are yours to use as you please. For example, you could do a 10-minute reading and have time for 10 minutes of feedback, or present a plot problem in 5 minutes and have 15 minutes of suggestions. It's entirely up to you, but remember that the more of your time you spend talking, the less time there is left for feedback and input!\n\nThe group will run for 2-2.5 hours, which will allow around six time-slots. If fewer people request slots, we'll be able to spend more time on feedback. If more people request a slot, priority is given to those who want input on their own work. If we still have too many, it'll be first-come, first-served, so don't be shy. :-)\n\nAfter the formal part of the meeting, we move upstairs for drinks.\n\nPlaces are limited, so please RSVP Yes and click the 'Pay by paypal' link to secure your place.\n\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line:\nhttps://www.streetmap.... (https://www.streetmap.co.uk/newmap.srf?x=533427&y=181615&z=0&ar=Y)\nTake the Bishopsgate exit from the main rail concourse, cross the road, turn left and Middlesex Street is 2nd right. The pub is about 100 metres down on the right-hand side, and we meet in the function room downstairs. Please arrive before 7pm so you have time to buy a drink at the upstairs bar beforehand, so we can start promptly at 7pm.\n\nTo encourage people to arrive on time, slots can only be booked on arrival and will be on a first-come, first-served basis.",

        "description": "London Writers Cafe is on again...\n\nLWC is a friendly get-together for London writers who want input, encouragement or feedback on their work. It's open to all writers; those who have just started to those who have had work published.\n\nBTW - At this one, I'll be doing a quick session on online marketing techniques every writer can use. This will include; websites to post your work and build a following, how to start and use a blog, search engine marketing, social networks and how to find your audience.\n\nThen we'll get back to regular schedule programming...\n\nThe meeting consists of six time-slots of 20 minutes. You can use this slot in whatever way would help your writing.\n\nYou might want to:\n- read (or bring) a short piece of writing and get feedback on it\n- describe a plot problem and get input on it\n- get ideas on how to break through writers' block\n- hear about writing events, news and website tools to use\n- network with other writers\n\nPlease bring ten copies for group members to share. If you don't have access to a printer, don't worry - please email it to me and I'll print copies for you.\n\nIf you are doing a reading, bear in mind that your total slot is 20 minutes, so I recommend your reading maximum of 10 minutes and allowing sufficient time for group feedback.\n\nSlots are booked on the night on a first-come, first-served basis. Please email me asap if you'd like a spot. We get booked up fast these days!\n\nCosts: £2 per session; paying by cash on the night or PayPal is set up when you RSVP.\n\nLocation:\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line.\n\nDirections: Take the Bishopsgate exit from the main rail concourse, cross the road, turn left and Middlesex Street is 2nd right. The pub is about 100 metres down on the right-hand side, and we meet in the function room downstairs.\n\nPlease call or text me on 07967175578 if you need directions.\n\nLooking forward to seeing everyone again :)\n\nbest,\nLisa (LWC Crowd Controller)",

We'll also have an fiction editor from HarperCollins UK followed by a panel discussion of Q&As from the audience.\nThis event aims to unveil some of the most common myths around getting published and tips from those who have made it\n\nA bit more about our guest authors:\nSue Moorcroft (https://www.suemoorcroft.com/)\nIn her own words: I'm a writer. I spend most of the week - and part of the weekend, and also some evenings - writing, mainly romantic fiction. The family are used to me and no-one ever suggests I get A Proper Job.\n\nKaren Mahoney (https://kazmahoney.com/)\nIn her own words: I write mostly for young adults, but have a number of projects underway and am always looking to challenge myself with new things. Visit the Books section to learn more about my forthcoming publications and works in progress. My first YA novel, The Iron Witch, will be published in the US in February 2011 and in Australia, March 2011.\n\nLeigh Russell (https://leighrussell.blogspot.com/)\nCUT SHORT, her first novel, has broken sales records in bookshops around the UK. A schedule of her other appearances can be found on her publisher's website.\nIn her own words: You may have heard me interviewed on one of many BBC Radio stations, or seen me featured or quoted in a newspaper. I am a member of the Curzon Group and post regularly on their blog. ROAD CLOSED, the second in the series, will be published in June 2010.\n\nLaura Deacon, Fiction Editor\nWe'll also have Laura Deacon, editor at Blue Door Books (https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/about-harpercollins/Imprints/blue-door/Pages/Blue-Door.aspx), talking about the submission and publishing process. She'll also be there to answer questions from guests from an editorial perspective.\n\nSpaces will be capped at 40 people so please RSVP early.\nThe normal meetup time has changed to 6:30 so we have enough time to get through the talks and get to question time. As a courtesy to the speakers, please be on time.\n\nPlease feel free to invite friends to this meetup and share the event on your social networks, if you have them :)\n\nActive members of LWC will be given first priority. A £6.50 charge for this event will be to cover costs of the speakers attending. Please pay by PayPal when you RSVP or email me that you'd rather pay on the night in cash.\n\nAny questions, please get in touch by email. Hopefully, this event will be just as successful as the last one!\n\nLocation and direction details:\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line.\nTake the Bishopsgate exit from the main rail concourse, cross the road, turn left and Middlesex Street is 2nd right.

I am there from 6.45pm.\n\nPlease bring a piece with you to read even if you think you don't want a slot - it's not uncommon for people to change their minds when they see how friendly we are. :-)\n\nWHERE?\nThe Shooting Star is less than 5 mins walk from Liverpool Street station, on the central Line.\nMeetup's map is wrong, so please follow these directions:\nTake the Bishopsgate exit from the main rail concourse, cross the road, turn left and Middlesex Street is 2nd right. The pub is about 100 metres down on the right-hand side, and we meet in the function room downstairs.\n\nWHEN?\nPlease arrive before 7pm so you have time to buy a drink at the upstairs bar beforehand, so we can start promptly at 7pm. (This hasn't ever happened yet, but I'm a hopeless optimist.)\n\nThe 'formal' part of the meeting runs until approximately 9.15pm. At that point, we move upstairs to the bar for general chat and the consumption of liquid sustenance.",

Spots are given on a first ask, first given basis with a couple of reserve spots.

        "description": "**A creative writing workshop exclusively for writers who have NEVER BEEN to any of our other events before, please feel welcome!** We're putting on this event for any writer who finds it comforting to know that everyone there is a newbie like them. We understand how daunting it can be to enter a group where others know each other so we're trying this out!\nIn this workshop, we invite two first-timers attending to read a piece of their work (up to 3,000 words) for feedback, advice and encouragement from the rest of the group. We can offer feedback on any storytelling form - part of a novel, short stories, screenplays or scripts - so long as it is under the word count. All feedback is constructive and respectful and moderated by your host. We've been holding these sessions as a safe space for writers of all kinds since 2006.\n\nAn example of what constructive feedback looks like: *'I liked this section for its energy, but have you thought about pacing it differently in this bit? I found it lagged because of too many adjectives.**'***\nWe always refer to what's on the page to give specific examples on the strengths and weaknesses of the storytelling or writing. Feedback is never personal nor offered without some evidence wherever possible.\n\nYou're very welcome to come along to listen, as you'll not be asked to contribute to the group feedback until you decide to do so. Observe first and contribute whenever you want to, that's completely all right by us. You'll be surprised by how much you can learn by listening to others' work and feedback.\n\nFor people reading, pieces must be 3,000 words or less as you'll have 35mins in total to read your piece and hear the feedback from the group. For the rest of the time, we'll spend talking about our writing projects, struggles and goals, so this session will be more relaxed than our regular workshops. Normally, we'll gather in the bar after the session for a few drinks and a chat too.\n\n**If you'd like to read at this workshop,** please post a (the) comment below (in the event discussion) *'I'd like to read'* and we'll confirm. Spots are given on a first ask, first given basis, with a reserve spot in case someone drops out. If you are reading, please bring 5-10 copies of your pages so the others can make additional notes and comments for you during the reading.

Ideally, beautifully written stories with a lot of heart. If you think your book might be a good fit please do come along and find out more.\n\n[ZunTold](https://www.zuntold.com/index.php?route=information/information&information_id=8) is an independent publishing company, based in Manchester, focusing on publishing good fiction to support mental health and wellbeing. They publish Middle Grade and YA fiction and love working with established voices as well as debut authors. Their authors have been nominated for literary prizes, including the Carnegie Medal, and won prestigious awards too, like the Lancashire Book of the Year Award, chosen solely by young people aged 13-14 years of age. They regularly work with agented authors, but, twice a year, they open our doors to unagented authors of Young Adult (YA) in June and Middle Grade in December. They don't publish picture books at the present time.\n\nThis workshop is suitable for writers of all levels.\n\nCosts: £10 per person. Follow the steps to pay via PayPal when you RSVP and refunds will only be offered if the meetup is cancelled by admin. After you RSVP you'll see a link in the event location box.

No one will see your work, or give you unsolicited advice. This is a group where we write quietly side by side - it is surprising how much more effective this is than doing it alone (also, when there's scones).\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n17.30 - arrive, order yourself a drink or pastry, get set up\n\n17.45 - quick intros: your name & goal for the session (if you want to share!)\n\n17.50 - timer starts! 1 hour writing block begins\n\n18.50 - quick recap: how'd it go?\n\nThose who'd like are welcome to stay on and write. The cafe is open until 21.30 (noting our table is only reserved until 19.00).\n\nWHERE: Jermyn St Café & Gallery on the mezzanine level of Waterstone's Piccadilly, at the long table in the back. I will have a sign on the table to identify us.\n\nFAQ:\n- Is it free? Yes! But please show your gratitude to our hosts by purchasing something to eat or drink.\n\n- What if I arrive late? Don't worry about it! Come to the table, grab a seat, and quietly start your writing.\n\n- Are there outlets? Unfortunately not at this venue - please come with your device fully charged, or bring some old school pen & paper.\n\n- Is there wifi? Yes, but it is temperamental - please be prepared to work without it, or to use your phone as a hotspot.\n\n- I can't make this time/location/week - will there be more? Yes! Keep your notifications on for this group; there will be more events scheduled at different times and venues.\n\n- I'm shy/don't want to talk about my writing - should I still come? Yes! There will be no pressure to engage, or to talk about your work, although those who would like to are welcome to do so after the writing block ends.\n\nI hope to see you there!",

This is a group where we write quietly side by side - it is surprising how much more effective this is than doing it alone (also, when there's scones).\n\nSCHEDULE:\n\n18.00 - arrive, order yourself a drink or pastry, get set up\n\n18.15 - quick intros: your name & goal for the session (if you want to share!)\n\n18.20 - timer starts! 1 hour writing block begins\n\n19.20 - quick recap: how'd it go?\n\nThose who'd like are welcome to stay on and write. The cafe is open until 21.30 (noting our table is only reserved until 20.00).\n\nWHERE: Jermyn St Café & Gallery on the mezzanine level of Waterstone's Piccadilly, at the long table in the back. I will have a sign on the table to identify us.\n\nFAQ:\n- Is it free? Yes! But please show your gratitude to our hosts by purchasing something to eat or drink.\n\n- What if I arrive late? Don't worry about it! Come to the table, grab a seat, and quietly start your writing.\n\n- Are there outlets? Unfortunately not at this venue - please come with your device fully charged, or bring some old school pen & paper.\n\n- Is there wifi? Yes, but it is temperamental - please be prepared to work without it, or to use your phone as a hotspot.\n\n- I can't make this time/location/week - will there be more? Yes! Keep your notifications on for this group; there will be more events scheduled at different times and venues.\n\n- I'm shy/don't want to talk about my writing - should I still come? Yes! There will be no pressure to engage, or to talk about your work, although those who would like to are welcome to do so after the writing block ends.\n\nI hope to see you there!",

        "description": "We will be running a social writing event in what used to be our family-run laundrette. Now a coffee house we love believes in creativity. I, as the owner, am writing a novel and will be joining the writing sessions along with attendees.\n\nThis is a writing workshop and created to encourage writers of all levels. I have been running similar sessions for 2 years, the last year they have been online but now with the opening up of businesses, I would like to resume these sessions.\n\nWriting workshops have been great opportunities for writers to spend concentrated time on the pieces. We do not run feedback sessions but these groups create the opportunity for writers to share their work with others in a social environment.

I, as the owner, am writing a novel and will be joining the writing sessions along with attendees.\n\nThis is a writing workshop and created to encourage writers of all levels. I have been running similar sessions for 2 years, the last year they have been online but now with the opening up of businesses, I would like to resume these sessions.\n\nWriting workshops have been great opportunities for writers to spend concentrated time on the pieces.

It can take away the loneliness out of writing and creates a fantastic opportunity to meet other writers. Not to mention the contagious effects of writing in silence alongside others.\n\nThe structure of the evening will consist of a short greeting, followed by writing in silence. At the end of the 2 hours, we will book a pub nearby and spend some time together sharing our own writing experience.\n\nI look forward to meeting all who want to come along.",

        "description": "We will be running a social writing event in what used to be our family-run laundrette. Now a coffee house we love believes in creativity. I, as the owner, am writing a novel and will be joining the writing sessions along with attendees.\n\nThis is a writing workshop and created to encourage writers of all levels. I have been running similar sessions for 2 years, the last year they have been online but now with the opening up of businesses, I would like to resume these sessions.\n\nWriting workshops have been great opportunities for writers to spend concentrated time on the pieces. We do not run feedback sessions but these groups create the opportunity for writers to share their work with others in a social environment. It can take away the loneliness out of writing and creates a fantastic opportunity to meet other writers. Not to mention the contagious effects of writing in silence alongside others.\n\nThe structure of the evening will consist of a short greeting, followed by writing in silence. At the end of the 2 hours, we will book a pub nearby and spend some time together sharing our own writing experience.\n\nI look forward to meeting all who want to come along.",

        "description": "This is a free introductory class which prepares students for the intensive 8-week script bootcamp. In this introductory class on July 25, professional repped screenwriter Conor Kyle will teach you the process of taking an idea and developing it into a story, outline and complete feature screenplay first draft.\n\nBring up to 3 loglines / brand new script ideas! Conor is requesting that students use newer, fresher ideas, and stay away from the magnum opuses you've been working on or thinking about for years. The intention behind this camp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThis event will take place on the Script Camp Discord server: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\n8-Week Script Bootcamp Course Description:\nIn this eight-week live bootcamp, you’ll go from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay. You’ll attend one three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an 80 to 120-page script. Conor will make plenty of time to take questions from students, as well as to review your work and offer feedback. This is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 4: Beginnings\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

        "description": "Sunday Script Bootcamp is an intensive 8-week course that meets weekly on Sundays. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle walks you through the process of conceiving, outlining and writing a complete 80-120 page first draft, with personal feedback on your loglines, outlines and script pages.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nThis event will take place on discord: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• You can either purchase this course \"a la carte\" (enter coupon code MEETUP50 when you check out for $50 off): https://scriptcamp.net/product/script-bootcamp-sunday/\n• Or start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 4: Beginnings\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\nThis event will take place on discord: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• Simply start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

        "description": "This intensive six-week live bootcamp meets weekly on Saturdays (Sundays GMT+10/GMT+12) and continues every week through September 25. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\nThis is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nHow to enroll in the 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• You can either purchase the complete course \"a la carte\": https://scriptcamp.net/product/pilot-bootcamp/\n• Or start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 2: Structure and Broad Strokes\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "This intensive six-week live bootcamp meets weekly on Saturdays (Sundays GMT+10/GMT+12) and continues every week through September 25. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot. This is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nWeek 2: Structure and Broad Strokes\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nHow to enroll in the 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• You can either purchase the complete course \"a la carte\": https://scriptcamp.net/product/pilot-bootcamp/\n• Or start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasizes this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle walks you through the process of conceiving, outlining and writing a complete 80-120 page first draft, with personal feedback on your loglines, outlines and script pages.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• Simply start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

Bring your logline for a feature film or TV Pilot (note that TV pilots require a series logline and pilot logline).

Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• Simply start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 8: Act 3\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?",

        "description": "Welcome to Outline Workshop! This is a weekly workshop designed to help you refine your screenplay outline using Conor Kyle's practical story development process.\n\nThis event is completely free and open to everyone. Space is limited, so be sure to hit the RSVP button. Then join us in the Workshop channel on discord ( https://discord.gg/kQfrX3R7Zy )\n\nIf you'd like to workshop your outline please post it in the #outlines channel on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/Kv827aqw6q ) along with your title and logline and we will review them in the order received. You should already have a very solid logline and either a rough Story Beats Outline or a more detailed Scene Cards Outline. If you need help with your logline, please drop by the weekly Logline Workshop meetup on Friday.\n\nSee below a breakdown of the story development steps Conor teaches. If you complete each step properly, it makes the next step a lot easier:\n\n1. The first step is to take your rough idea and develop this into a solid logline that can sustain a feature film. (Or if this is a TV pilot, you need to develop a series logline and a pilot logline.) Here's an example logline template from Conor: “When (INCITING INCIDENT), a (ADJECTIVE) (PROTAGONIST) must (CONFLICT) before / or else (STAKES or TICKING CLOCK).” It's difficult to perfect a logline by yourself. Usually this requires some help and feedback from fellow writers.\n\n2. The second step is filling up your sketchbook. This can be google docs, Evernote, MS word, whatever you use for notes. Brainstorm lots of fun ideas for scenes, develop your theme, anti-theme and flesh out your characters. Whatever sort of notes and doodling process you need to develop your story. Some writers find it helpful to collect photos and artwork at this stage as well.\n\n3. The third step is to break out your story into beats and develop a Story Beats Outline with estimated pages for each section and a list of scenes. If you are writing a 90 page script, for example, your Story Beats Outline is going to have sections something like this, with a list of scene breakdowns in each section.\n\nIntro (1-10):\n\nCatalyst (10):\n\nDebate (10-20):\n\nBreak into 2 (20):\n\nFun and Games (20-45):\n\nMidpoint (45):\n\nBad Guys Close In (45-60):\n\nAll is Lost (60):\n\nDark Night of the Soul (61-70):\n\nBreak Into 3 (70):\n\nFinale (70-90):\n\n4. The next step is called a Scene Cards Outline. This is a detailed prose description of what happens in every single scene (not sluglines, but dramatic scenes), with estimated page count for each scene, dialogue excerpts and as much as you can of the action description that will end up in your first draft. This stage of your outlining process should feel more like writing than outlining. You are getting the heavy lifting out of the way, so that when you sit down to start the first draft, the pages are going to fly very quickly.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I have no idea how to create a screenplay outline. Is it okay if I just join to listen and learn?\nA: Absolutely! This workshop is entirely free and everyone is welcome to join.\n\nQ: My writing is ____ genre, is that okay?\nA: Yes! Bring your outline for a feature film or TV Pilot, whatever genre you're working on.\n\nQ: I don't have a solid logline yet.\nA: If you're having trouble with your logline, drop by our weekly Logline Workshop on Friday or post your logline in the #ideas-and-loglines channel for feedback on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/E2sDHGfwG8 ).\n\nQ: I'm worried that my outline sucks, should I still bring it?\nA: Rough drafts and outlines are always rough. Nobody will be perfect. We're here to support you, which means pointing out the parts that are awesome and providing honest feedback for improvement.",

Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot. This is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nPlease note this class is not free. To join you must enroll in Unlimited Script Camp on our website.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nHow to enroll in the TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• Start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nWeek 2: Structure and Broad Strokes\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasizes this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?\n\nHow to enroll in the Sunday Script Bootcamp:\n• Simply start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your ideas, outlines and pages from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then drop by our discord server and meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nComplete schedule:\nWeek 1: Why this story?\nNow that you've narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You'll refine and polish your story's premise, and begin the process of outlining.\n\nWeek 2: Outlining I – Broad Strokes\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nWeek 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\nWeek 5: Transitions\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\nWeek 6: Act 2 A\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\nWeek 7: Act 2 B\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.",

        "description": "Welcome to Outline Workshop! This is a weekly workshop designed to help you refine your screenplay outline using Conor Kyle's practical story development process.\n\nThis event is completely free and open to everyone. Space is limited, so be sure to hit the RSVP button. Then join us in the Workshop channel on Script Camp discord ( https://discord.gg/kQfrX3R7Zy )\n\nIf you'd like to workshop your outline please post it in the #outlines channel on the Script Camp discord ( https://discord.gg/Kv827aqw6q ) along with your title and logline and we will review them in the order received. You should already have a very solid logline and either a rough Story Beats Outline or a more detailed Scene Cards Outline. If you need help with your logline, please drop by the weekly Logline Workshop meetup on Friday.\n\nSee below a breakdown of the story development steps Conor teaches. If you complete each step properly, it makes the next step a lot easier:\n\n1. The first step is to take your rough idea and develop this into a solid logline that can sustain a feature film. (Or if this is a TV pilot, you need to develop a series logline and a pilot logline.) Here's an example logline template from Conor: “When (INCITING INCIDENT), a (ADJECTIVE) (PROTAGONIST) must (CONFLICT) before / or else (STAKES or TICKING CLOCK).” It's difficult to perfect a logline by yourself. Usually this requires some help and feedback from fellow writers.\n\n2. The second step is filling up your sketchbook. This can be google docs, Evernote, MS word, whatever you use for notes. Brainstorm lots of fun ideas for scenes, develop your theme, anti-theme and flesh out your characters. Whatever sort of notes and doodling process you need to develop your story. Some writers find it helpful to collect photos and artwork at this stage as well.\n\n3. The third step is to break out your story into beats and develop a Story Beats Outline with estimated pages for each section and a list of scenes. If you are writing a 90 page script, for example, your Story Beats Outline is going to have sections something like this, with a list of scene breakdowns in each section.\n\nIntro (1-10):\n\nCatalyst (10):\n\nDebate (10-20):\n\nBreak into 2 (20):\n\nFun and Games (20-45):\n\nMidpoint (45):\n\nBad Guys Close In (45-60):\n\nAll is Lost (60):\n\nDark Night of the Soul (61-70):\n\nBreak Into 3 (70):\n\nFinale (70-90):\n\n4. The next step is called a Scene Cards Outline. This is a detailed prose description of what happens in every single scene (not sluglines, but dramatic scenes), with estimated page count for each scene, dialogue excerpts and as much as you can of the action description that will end up in your first draft. This stage of your outlining process should feel more like writing than outlining. You are getting the heavy lifting out of the way, so that when you sit down to start the first draft, the pages are going to fly very quickly.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I have no idea how to create a screenplay outline. Is it okay if I just join to listen and learn?\nA: Absolutely! This workshop is entirely free and everyone is welcome to join.\n\nQ: My writing is ____ genre, is that okay?\nA: Yes! Bring your outline for a feature film or TV Pilot, whatever genre you're working on.\n\nQ: I don't have a solid logline yet.\nA: If you're having trouble with your logline, drop by our weekly Logline Workshop on Friday or post your logline in the #ideas-and-loglines channel for feedback on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/E2sDHGfwG8 ).\n\nQ: I'm worried that my outline sucks, should I still bring it?\nA: Rough drafts and outlines are always rough. Nobody will be perfect. We're here to support you, which means pointing out the parts that are awesome and providing honest feedback for improvement.",

        "description": "This intensive six-week live bootcamp meets weekly on Saturdays (Sundays GMT+10/GMT+12) and continues every week through September 25. Pro screenwriter Conor Kyle takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a three-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot. This is an intensive crash-course for all skill levels, intended to keep students motivated and on track as they make their story come to life.\n\nPlease note this class is not free. To join you must enroll in Unlimited Script Camp on our website.\n\nWeek 5: Second act\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\nHow to enroll in the TV Pilot Bootcamp:\n• Start your free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership (includes access to all Saturday bootcamps, Sunday bootcamps, regular feedback on your work from pro screenwriter Conor Kyle, plus all the supplemental weekday classes, over 30 hours of live classes per month): https://scriptcamp.net/membership/\n• Then join us on discord, meet Conor and your fellow students: https://discord.gg/mUtQKbtsgb\n\nAbout the Instructor:\nConor Kyle has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies.\n\nWeek 1: Concept and Loglines\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\nWeek 2: Structure and Broad Strokes\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\nWeek 3: Scene Cards\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasizes this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\nWeek 4: First Act\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\nWeek 6: Third act\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by now you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "Welcome to Logline Workshop! This is a weekly workshop designed to help you refine your feature film logline or TV pilot logline.\n\nThis event is completely free and open to everyone. Space is limited, so be sure to hit the RSVP button. Then join us in the Workshop channel on discord ( https://discord.gg/kQfrX3R7Zy )\n\nIf you'd like to workshop your logline please post it in the #ideas-and-loglines channel on the Script Camp Discord ( https://discord.gg/E2sDHGfwG8 ) along with your title, genre and comps, and we will review them in the order received.\n\nHere's an example logline template from Conor:\n“When (INCITING INCIDENT), a (ADJECTIVE) (PROTAGONIST) must (CONFLICT) before / or else (STAKES or TICKING CLOCK).”\n\nIt's difficult to perfect a logline by yourself. Usually this requires some help and feedback from fellow writers.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: I have no idea how to create a logline. Is it okay if I just join to listen and learn?\nA: Absolutely! This workshop is entirely free and everyone is welcome to join.\n\nQ: What's the purpose of a logline?\nA: The logline is not only a way to get others interested in reading your script, but it's also an important step in the outlining and writing process. Usually it requires a little help from others to workshop a rough idea into a strong logline that seems like it can sustain a feature length story. And then it serves as your North star while developing the idea, constructing your outline, and writing the first draft\n\nQ: My writing is ____ genre, is that okay?\nA: Yes! Bring your logline for a feature film or TV Pilot (note that TV pilots require a series logline and pilot logline). Any genre is OK.\n\nQ: I'm worried that my logline sucks, should I still bring it?\nA: This is a process. Nobody will be perfect. We're here to support you, which means pointing out the parts that are awesome and providing honest feedback for improvement.",

        "description": "The eight-week Bootcamp runs June 24 through August 12. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\nThe intention behind this bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to join the 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* Please note this class is not free.\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: [https://scriptcamp.net/classes](https://scriptcamp.net/classes)\n* Or start your free trial $49 Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n* Then join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n***8-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Why this story? / Sketchbook (June 24)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. During this class, you’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the process of filling out your sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (July 1)**\nNow that you’ve filled out your sketchbook, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion?

        "description": "The complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly every Sunday. Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (July 31)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**\n• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/)\n• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n\n***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Loglines & Sketchbook (July 3)**\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (July 10)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (July 17)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 24)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (July 31)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Aug 7)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "The eight-week Bootcamp runs June 24 through August 12. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\nThe intention behind this bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to join the 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* Please note this class is not free.\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: [https://scriptcamp.net/classes](https://scriptcamp.net/classes)\n* Or start your free trial $49 Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n* Then join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n***8-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Why this story? / Sketchbook (June 24)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. During this class, you’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the process of filling out your sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (July 1)**\nNow that you’ve filled out your sketchbook, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!",

The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (July 10)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (July 17)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 24)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (July 31)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Aug 7)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs.

        "description": "The eight-week Bootcamp runs June 24 through August 12. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\nThe intention behind this bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n***How to join the 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:***\n\n* Please note this class is not free.\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: [https://scriptcamp.net/classes](https://scriptcamp.net/classes)\n* Or start your free trial $49 Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n* Then join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n***8-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n**Week 1: Why this story? / Sketchbook (June 24)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. During this class, you’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the process of filling out your sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (July 1)**\nNow that you’ve filled out your sketchbook, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (July 8)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your story beats into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (July 15)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (July 22)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (July 29)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (August 5)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (August 12)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of this week you will have finished a complete feature-length screenplay!",

        "description": "**How to Write a Movie!**\nThis class breaks down Conor Kyle's process for writing a screenplay in eight weeks. It all starts with your logline. Bring up to 3 loglines or brand new movie ideas! Conor is requesting that students use newer, fresher ideas, and stay away from the magnum opuses you’ve been working on or thinking about for years.\n\nThe intention behind the bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThe 8-week bootcamp starts August 21 and continues weekly through October 9. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos)** and **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)**\n\n**How to join the free class:**\n\n* Hit the RSVP button\n* Then join us on Discord: **[https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)**\n\n**How to join Conor's 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: **[https://scriptcamp.net/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/classes/)**\n* Or start the free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the new Script Camp Writers Lab: **[https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)**\n\n***8-Week Feature Bootcamp course schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (Sep 4)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 11)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (Sep 18)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (Sep 25)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (Oct 2)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (Oct 9)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? By the end of this week you will complete your 90-120 page first draft!",

        "description": "Ready to write a TV pilot? This free class provides an how to develop your pilot idea and write the script in six weeks. We’ll dive into the construction of your premise, characters and story world as you refine the concept for the project you will write during the intensive six-week TV Pilot Bootcamp. ***Bring your loglines and original show ideas!***\n\nThe complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly on Friday (US) / Saturdays (Australia/NZ). Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to enroll in the free class?**\n• Hit the RSVP button\n• Join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**\n• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/)\n• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n\n***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Loglines & Sketchbook (Aug 26)**\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (Sep 2)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (Sep 9)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 16)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (Sep 23)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Sep 30)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\nThe intention behind the bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThe 8-week bootcamp starts August 21 and continues weekly through October 9. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos)** and **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)**\n\n**How to join the free class:**\n\n* Hit the RSVP button\n* Then join us on Discord: **[https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)**\n\n**How to join Conor's 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: **[https://scriptcamp.net/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/classes/)**\n* Or start the free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the new Script Camp Writers Lab: **[https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)**\n\n***8-Week Feature Bootcamp course schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (Sep 4)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 11)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (Sep 18)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (Sep 25)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (Oct 2)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (Oct 9)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? By the end of this week you will complete your 90-120 page first draft!",

        "eventUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/scriptcampuk/events/287386669",
        "description": "Ready to write a TV pilot? This free class provides an how to develop your pilot idea and write the script in six weeks. We’ll dive into the construction of your premise, characters and story world as you refine the concept for the project you will write during the intensive six-week TV Pilot Bootcamp. ***Bring your loglines and original show ideas!***\n\nThe complete six-week **TV Pilot Bootcamp** course meets weekly on Friday (US) / Saturdays (Australia/NZ). Pro screenwriter **Conor Kyle** takes you from blank page to the first draft of a complete original pilot screenplay. You’ll attend a two-hour class session each week in which we’ll walk through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing an original TV pilot.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. You can view Conor's previous class videos on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)\n\n**How to enroll in the free class?**\n• Hit the RSVP button\n• Join us on Discord: [https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)\n\n**How to enroll in the complete 6-week TV Pilot Bootcamp:**\n• You can either purchase the course *“a la carte”*: [https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/product/classes/)\n• Or start your free trial **Unlimited Script Camp** membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the weekly Script Camp Writers Lab: [https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)\n\n***Complete 6-Week Bootcamp Course Schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Loglines & Sketchbook (Aug 26)**\nWe begin this course by zeroing in on the high concept core premise, and developing two separate loglines to express this idea. The first is the series logline, and the second is the pilot logline. These will act as guideposts to keep us on track through construction of your script. We’ll also start filling out our sketchbooks, brainstorming a few different episode ideas from our prospective first season, to get a sense of where your show should begin, and where it’s headed.\n\n**Week 2: Story Beats (Sep 2)**\nNow that you have a solid grasp on the basics of your show, you’ll begin sketching out the key characters, plot points, and set-pieces in your pilot episode. Whether you’re planning for a 30-minute or 60-minute episode, you’ll need to carefully structure and pace your outline to ensure that you’re delivering on the promise of your premise quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n**Week 3: Scene Cards (Sep 9)**\nTime to start getting concrete. This class focuses on nailing down every scene from your pilot as a “scene card,” which is essentially a synopsis for every single major moment in your show. ScriptCamp heavily emphasises this part of the process, and we will make an exhaustive roadmap through your entire story before starting pages next week.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 16)**\nNow is when you’ll put pen to paper and begin drafting pages. You’ll have to write an act a week in order to keep up with the group’s milestones, and this is the first of three weekly check-ins in which we’ll evaluate your progress, troubleshoot issues, and give feedback.\n\n**Week 5: Second Act (Sep 23)**\nYou’re in the thick of your script, and this class will feature both a short lecture on second acts and setpieces, as well as a lot of feedback on your in-progress pages. The goal is to keep your energy and momentum up as you approach the finale of your story, so we’ll ensure that your pacing, plot progression, and character arcs are all taking the reader in the right direction.\n\n**Week 6: Endings (Sep 30)**\nTime to finish strong. We’ll again diagnose issues with your in-progress scripts, and discuss crafting the ideal “unexpected but inevitable” finale. Plus, where do we go from here? Once the script is done, we’ll discuss show bibles, contests and fellowships, and all the steps on the long road toward those coveted TV writing jobs. But more importantly, congratulations: by the end of week 6 you will have finished a complete pilot script!",

        "description": "**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\nThe intention behind the bootcamp is not for you to write a perfect script, but instead to teach you the organization skills, discipline, and craft techniques that will set you on the path to becoming a professional screenwriter.\n\nThe 8-week bootcamp starts August 21 and continues weekly through October 9. Conor takes you from a blank page to the first draft of a complete feature screenplay, walking you through the entire process of conceiving, outlining, and writing a 90-120 page script.\n\n***About the Instructor:***\n**Conor Kyle** has written for Shudder's Creepshow (2019) and placed twice in the Nicholl Fellowship with his scripts “Peter and the Wolves” (quarterfinals, also Launchpad top 10) and The Tube (semifinals). His screenplays have also been featured on special sections of the annual Hit List, Young & Hungry List, Spec Book, and on Tracking Board’s “Best Writers of the Year” booklet. He writes everything from stage musicals to Westerns to horror movies. Follow Conor on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheScriptCamp), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTkV9mxO1_wqfUsoGe7mXg/videos)** and **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/scriptcamp)**\n\n**How to join Conor's 8-week Screenwriting Bootcamp:**\n\n* You can either purchase the full course “a la carte”: **[https://scriptcamp.net/classes/](https://scriptcamp.net/classes/)**\n* Or start the free trial Unlimited Script Camp membership with access to over 70 hours of live classes, workshops and bootcamps every month, including the new Script Camp Writers Lab: **[https://scriptcamp.net/membership/](https://scriptcamp.net/membership/)**\n* Then join us on Discord: **[https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna](https://discord.gg/Qy3E35DZna)**\n\n***8-Week Feature Bootcamp course schedule:***\n\n**Week 1: Why this story? (Aug 21)**\nNow that you’ve narrowed down your high-concept idea, we will ask the simple questions: why this story? Why now? What is both timely and universal in your idea? We will begin to chisel away at the central dramatic question of your script, and design a plan to explore this theme from all angles. You’ll refine and polish your story’s premise, and begin the outlining process with your project sketchbook.\n\n**Week 2: Outlining I – Story Beats (Aug 28)**\nNow that you’ve selected your feature idea, we’ll look at the key building blocks of your story. Chiefly: how to structure and place key scenes, and begin to establish connective tissue between them.\n\n**Week 3: Outlining II – Scene Cards (Sep 4)**\nTime to organize your ideas into a much more detailed outline. These “scene cards” will each feature a key moment of your story, and you’ll organize your brainstormed sketches into a cohesive, page-by-page plan for your upcoming feature.\n\n**Week 4: Beginnings (Sep 11)**\nIt’s time to get going on your feature! This class will feature a both a FAQ / troubleshooting session (where we address and fill holes in your outlines before you begin) and a lecture on first acts: everything from opening image to the act break. From this class on, you’ll have to write a few pages a day to keep up with the benchmarks and get optimal feedback on your script.\n\n**Week 5: Transitions (Sep 18)**\nYou’ve finished the first 20-30 pages of your script, so this class focuses on your first act break. How do we diagnose whether we’ve done everything we need to do in act one? We’ll heavily emphasize a propulsive boost into the “fun and games” of your script’s second act, balancing B-stories, and more.\n\n**Week 6: Second Act (Sep 25)**\nThis class follows us into the deep dark woods of your script: the second act. We’ll go over the creation of sequences and setpieces, and review how to find the fun in your premise and mine its full potential.\n\n**Week 7: Escalation (Oct 2)**\nMany newer writers begin to falter or repeat themselves in this section of a script, so we’ll focus on keeping up the energy and narrative push, as well as beginning to answer questions and pay off setups from earlier in the script. Danger and tension must ramp up significantly in this section, and we’ll make sure our scripts are doing just that.\n\n**Week 8: Endings (Oct 9)**\nIn our eighth and final week, we will work through the difficult final act of your script. How do we conclude subplots? How can we leave the reader feeling satisfied with the ideal “unexpected yet inevitable” conclusion? By the end of this week (Oct 16) you will complete your 90-120 page first draft!",

Clearly it's something that many could get value from. So it really is high time we got things moving properly.\n\nI know most people would prefer to meet up in person. I'm setting up this relaunch chat as a Zoom meeting only to test the water, gauge interest and agree a way forward with group members. So if you're still keen, please do come along to show your support, then we can schedule in some regular dates to meet in real life as we move into spring. This is your group, so let's make this happen together!\n\nPS. One idea I'd like to explore is the possibility of arranging talks by successful authors. I already have someone in mind as a possible first guest – a friend of mine who's now selling 2000 books a day. (That's right – per day.) Obviously we need an audience first, though. So be sure to come along if this is something that piques your interest.",

        "description": "Hey folks. *Not* a new event: I just need your help and this post is too long to publish as a discussion.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI've set up a Facebook group for discussions around the Brighton Authors' Group Meetup. Please join if you can – it will be our main platform for discussions, including talking about how to develop the Meetup. It will also confirm that there's still enough interest for me to keep this group running.\n\nhttps://facebook.com/groups/423977218898637/\n\nLonger version\n\nWhen I set up this group a few weeks ago, my aim was to meet what I suspected was an unmet need in Brighton: camaraderie, moral and practical support, and advice for writers (both established and aspiring).\n\nWe’re already at ten members, so it looks like my instincts were right. But we’re at a delicate stage now, where things could go either way. Joining Meetup groups is easy, but they need nurturing if they’re to avoid fizzling out after the first flush of enthusiasm.\n\nI’d hoped that we could meet up regularly and in person. However, the recent Covid surge (which, thankfully, seems to be receding) meant that we had to start with a virtual Meetup.\n\nI realise this was far from ideal, especially when most of us have had enough of Zoom after 18 months. And people have suggested they’d like to meet up in real life as soon as we can. I would certainly like that too.\n\nPersonally, I’m not quite ready for a Meetup inside a crowded pub. But it looks like the weather could be about to improve again, allowing us to gather for a chat at an outside venue.\n\nIn the meantime, though, we need to keep up the momentum. I’ve therefore set up a Facebook group, so we can start some discussions, share any challenges we’d like help with and generally get to know each other a bit better. (I’m not a huge fan of Facebook – my initial choice was WhatsApp – but I think it’s still one of the best platforms for groups.)\n\nBut first, an important caveat. Writing can be a scary business. Committing words to a page takes a lot of courage. Fear, lack of confidence, writer’s block or imposter syndrome are problems we all face at one time or another (often all at once, every day).\n\nThis group is absolutely not about adding to that pressure. There’s no homework. And there’s no shaming. But there is safety in numbers. So if you’re hesitating to dip a toe in the water because you feel you haven’t written enough, don’t worry. That’s not what we’re about. This group is here to help you, but that help could just be normalising the strange activities that life as an author boils down to: living inside your head, making stuff up and selling it :-)\n\nIn my experience, just being around other authors (and would-be authors) can be enormously helpful. After all, most people we meet don't do what we do. So just meeting those who are on a similar journey is often enough to kick-start progress again.\n\nAnd that help I need from you? Just to support the group and keep it going. Step one is easy: just click the link below and join the Facebook group. That’s all. It will show me that there’s still support for what I’m trying to do, and it will help us start to build this into the supportive, inclusive community I’m sure it can be.\n\nDo it now, if you can. It only takes a second (there are no questions to answer) and doing it now will stop it getting lost among the Meetup noise.\n\nI hope to see you in there. Thanks. 😊\n\nhttps://facebook.com/groups/423977218898637/",

        "description": "Join us for a conversation on “Writing as a Sacred Act” where we contemplate the questions:\n• Where do stories come from? Do we choose them or do they find us?\n• Do they spontaneously emerge from some Freudian memory scrap?\n• Or, do they descend like angels from a Jungian archetypal kingdom?\n• What’s the best way to begin a story?\n• What’s the best strategy to overcome writer’s block?\n\nSome stories taunt their writers with an irresistible idea then outright refuse to cooperate with the telling, leaving their writers completely in the dark as to how or where begin. Yet these rascally stories incessantly demand to be written. Other stories get rolling with great momentum only to abruptly abandon their writers leaving nothing behind but an unending, never diminishing, unrequited hope-against-hope of return.\n\nIn the great cave of the unconscious runs a gold vein of fables waiting to be mined by your daydreams and forged into shape through a fiery battle of ego and soul. Stories are “literary beings” that carry our knowledge and wisdom. They are as essential to our survival as food. The archetypal role of storyteller is a powerfully serious, ultimately sacred role. It is from stories that we form the phantom body of our collective identity, be it a small family or an entire people. Stories can spark new nations into manifesting, while carrying others into disillusionment and disintegration. The imagination of a single writer can carry millions of others to the glorious heights and devastating depths of human experience. Stories lull babies to happy sleep, send us chasing after love, or sometimes marching off to war. Stories show us where to find the courage to sacrifice our egos for the greater ecstasy of compassion. Stories not only inspire us, they are us.\nJoin us for an inspiring conversation.",

It's taken me longer than expected to make venue arrangements, but now we're all set.\n\nThe first meeting will be Tuesday, 15th January, at the Thames Court Pub on the Towpath at Shepperton, TW17 9LP. They've got a great room for us, just upstairs to the right as you come in, and they do nice food for those coming straight from work who want a bite to eat.\n\nAs it's our first meeting I expect the initial agenda to cover who we are and what we aspire to achieve together as a writers' group. I've some ideas, but I'm keen to hear what you think and the experiences you bring to the group. If you've participated in other writers' groups in the past, I'll want to learn what you liked and what you didn't like.\n\nAnyone keen to read a piece of their own writing, please keep it to less than 5 minutes and drop me a message to let me know so I can plan for timings.\n\nI'm looking forward to meeting you next Tuesday!\n\nIf you will have trouble getting to the Thames Court transport-wise, message me and I'll see what we can do.\n\n£3 per person to cover the room charge.\n\nKind regards,\n\nKathleen Tyson\n07554 348843",

Note the Oxford or serial comma there.\n\nOur discussion of 'The Elements of Style' quickly led to a debate on the Oxford comma, with the group about evenly split between those who favour the comma and those who don't see the point. That led to discussion of the correct use of fewer and less, and whether it was appropriate in writing dialogue to break the rules. Yeah, prob'ly. But we all agreed that verbising nouns is just wrong.\n\nAs we had new people we spent some time on introductions and sharing our ambitions for writing. We have four novels in progress, one possible novel or screenplay, a collection of anecdotes, poetry for performance, and short stories.\n\nAGENDA for our next meeting is a tutorial on self-publishing software for creating photo or illustrated books, publishing on Amazon's KDP platform (both print and Kindle), and using self-publishing houses that provide formatting and editing services.\n\nAfter that everyone will be invited to read about 5 minutes of their work so we get a sense of style from each other.\n\nCost £3 to cover the room, down to £2 if we are more than 10 people.\n\nSee you all on Tuesday, 12th February, 7:30 at the Thames Court!\n\nKind regards,\n\nKathleen\n07554 348 843\n\nA Fun TED Talk on the Oxford comma:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptM7FzyjtRk",

I'm immensely grateful to David for his preparation of a 'how to' guide on self-publishing on KDP/Amazon. He passed out also a list of websites that offer tutorials or 'how to' information, and as he is learning as he goes, proved that we can publish what we want to. Guy also shared his experience of using self-publishing services which format the content and prepare a cover for your book, but at a price. It was great to get a range of experience and encourage each other.\n\nWe finally got brave enough for readings! Most of us brought something we'd written, sometimes a while ago, to share.\n\nMike led with his children's story 'Bubble Trouble' which has been read on the radio. Jerry followed with his humorous verse parable 'The Well'. Rosina read some of her poetry evoking nature and a lullaby of sky and trees. Paula darkened the tone with the opening rape scene of her novel, 'Believe Me', which had me gripping the table and gasping at the power of it. Karen read some of her novel of Samoa, which features a family in conflict. David read us 'Sylvia's Letters', with its cruel twist in the final revelation. Guy read us a scene of Big Cat sightings from his sci-fi book. I read a bit of my satire on local current affairs, 'Buy-to-Let Borough Council'.\n\nChit chat afterward is that we all felt liberated to read to such a supportive group and grateful for the constructive feedback received.\n\nAGENDA for the next meeting will be a screenwriting exercise called The Five-Fingered Pitch, which forces a focus on how to explain your work concisely to someone who can help you realise it with publication or production.\n\nAnd then more readings, please!\n\nAnd if you are enjoying our meetings please leave feedback as it encourages me and may bring others to join us.",

        "description": "At our 26th February meeting we did the exercise of the 5 Finger Pitch, a concept developed for film pitches by Michael Lengsfield. You can have him teach you at FutureLearn: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/screenwriting/0/steps/10488\n\nThe idea is that if writers meet a publisher or producer, and get the opportunity to pitch their work, they should pitch it in a concise and meaningful way that will engage commercial interest. Instead of describing plot points, which gets boring really fast even if the writing is terrific, they should describe their work in a more structured way. That sort of professionalism should invite a conversation about developing the work if the publisher or producer finds it interesting.\n\nWe then had more readings, which was really wonderful again. I'm inspired by everyone who brings their work to read to us! Karen read a thought-provoking piece based on her mother's death. Guy gave us the non-fiction complex politics of the 1960s Tory party. David read his twisty short story 'Abduction in Cremona'. Gerry gave us his comic verse 'The Husband Trap' - which we think should be published so it can be read out at weddings! Rosina, now in her 80s, read us her very first short story ever - written last week - 'Food for Thought', wonderful imagery ending with her rolling in snow under stars on the river bank. I read the opening paragraphs of my 'Godwin the Sea Lord' historical novel. Once again we were all joyful and admiring of the talent we each bring to our group.\n\nGuy has suggested the topic for our next meeting be about whether depiction of race must change for modern readers. He wondered whether Dr Fu Manchu books could be written today. Certainly Sax Rohmer's Chinese evil genius was inspired by and catered to a culture of racism, isolationism and paranoia.

        "description": "At our 26th February meeting we did the exercise of the 5 Finger Pitch, a concept developed for film pitches by Michael Lengsfield. You can have him teach you at FutureLearn: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/screenwriting/0/steps/10488\n\nThe idea is that if writers meet a publisher or producer, and get the opportunity to pitch their work, they should pitch it in a concise and meaningful way that will engage commercial interest. Instead of describing plot points, which gets boring really fast even if the writing is terrific, they should describe their work in a more structured way. That sort of professionalism should invite a conversation about developing the work if the publisher or producer finds it interesting.\n\nWe then had more readings, which was really wonderful again. I'm inspired by everyone who brings their work to read to us! Karen read a thought-provoking piece based on her mother's death. Guy gave us the non-fiction complex politics of the 1960s Tory party. David read his twisty short story 'Abduction in Cremona'. Gerry gave us his comic verse 'The Husband Trap' - which we think should be published so it can be read out at weddings! Rosina, now in her 80s, read us her very first short story ever - written last week - 'Food for Thought', wonderful imagery ending with her rolling in snow under stars on the river bank. I read the opening paragraphs of my 'Godwin the Sea Lord' historical novel. Once again we were all joyful and admiring of the talent we each bring to our group.\n\nGuy has suggested the topic for our next meeting be about whether depiction of race must change for modern readers. He wondered whether Dr Fu Manchu books could be written today. Certainly Sax Rohmer's Chinese evil genius was inspired by and catered to a culture of racism, isolationism and paranoia. Rohmer, who knew nothing of China, asked a ouija board for the most dangerous competitor to white man, and said the board spelled out C-H-I-N-A-M-A-N. The idea of the Yellow Peril was spreading in parallel with Asian economic development and rising educational attainments, and Dr Fu Manchu put a face - and a moustache - to the racist fear of the rising East, selling 20 million books.\n\nArguably James Bond books and movies sold by inflaming a similar fear of the Commie Threat during the Cold War, along with lovely travelogue locations.\n\nIn contrast a modern imagined race and place is the Botswana of Mma Precious Ramotswe, from the No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series of 19 novels (so far) by Alexander McCall Smith.

        "description": "Our discussion on Tuesday evening was on the tricky subject of racial characterisation. Guy had raised the topic with Dr Fu Manchu, who to him wasn't even intended as Chinese as the Manchus could pass for European (and the character in film was played by Christopher Leigh). To his thinking the character wasn't racist as Dr Fu Manchu had nobility; his ambition to rule the world was allowable because he would rule it better. Nonetheless the character was part of the 'Yellow Peril' and Commie scare-mongering of the mid-20th century. After a wide-ranging discussion of race characterisation - from Mma Ramotswe to Death in Paradise and beyond - we concluded that there weren't any fixed rules. Writers should develop characters of whatever complexion that are well-rounded, true to themselves, and true for the reader.\n\nThen we got to the fun we are all now anticipating as the highlight of our meetings: the Readings! David read a short piece on how technology is driving us. Rosina read a poem that wonderfully creates the rhythm of an underground train as it captures a journey. Paula offered a fiction segment on interrogation of Nazis at Nuremberg. Mike read a synopsis of his sci-fi project which had us all begging for more. Guy entertained with his comic weighing of the advantages of chocolate versus sex and vice versa. Karen gave us more of her crazy family of sisters, whose contrasting characters complicate their reunion after mother's death. I read the next pages of my novel, when Godwin finds his own dead mother in the ruins of his burned down home.\n\nAGENDA: Next meeting on 26th March I thought we might discuss George Orwell's Rules for Written English from 'Politics and the English Language'. The essay is well worth reading, but to make it easy for you I'll summarise here:\n1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.\n2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.\n3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.\n5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.\n\nFull essay here: https://faculty.washington.edu/rsoder/EDLPS579/HonorsOrwellPoliticsEnglishLanguage.pdf\n\nAnd, of course, more Readings!",

        "description": "Apologies, Wordsmiths, that it has taken me so long to write up the last meeting and schedule the next through MeetUp. I've been away in deepest, darkest Devon - actually sea level and overwhelmingly white. I gained a new perspective on urban versus rural, and am a now more aware of the social divisions driving the disunity we see every day in national politics. Anyway, although Devon offered some entertainment, I'm glad to be back in 21st century multicultural Greater London.\n\nOur 26th March meeting discussed Orwell's 6 rules for writing, which appear above. These were generally welcomed as reinforcing some of the good habits we've been exploring for clearer writing since the Shepperton Wordsmiths first met, and the flexibility implied by the last rule was encouraging. Several of us have been reviewing past writing from a perspective of these rules and those offered by Strunk & White's Elements of Style, and Stein on Writing, and have been improving our past work. All of us seem to have a bit more confidence and are enjoying our writing, especially now that we're sharing it with each other.\n\nNot everyone came with a reading, not everyone has to! Those that did read for us offered a broad spectrum:\nDavid gave us another of his short stories - this one with a cunning twist.\nGerry gave us one of his cabbie stories of 'big tipper' customers for 138 Portchester.\nGuy took us from the past to the future and the future to the past until we became \"strangers in our own era\".\nKaren read a prologue setting her characters in scene before they engage with each other in the story.\nI read a bit more of Godwin the Sea Lord, where young Godwin anticipates his father's vengeance for the death of his mother, siblings, and the Combe bondsmen.\n\nDavid has come up with the challenge for our next meeting, Tuesday 16th April, of writing a couple paragraphs each of action or conflict. That's easy for me with a cast of 11th century Vikings to write for!\n\nIf you want some ideas, check out this handy list of 50 action writing prompts: https://www.bryndonovan.com/2018/10/11/50-fight-scene-writing-prompts-and-ideas/\n\nSo, if you have time between now and Tuesday (and I apologise again for leaving this late) write up a short but nasty conflict or exciting action scene to share with your fellow Wordsmiths.\n\nKind regards,\n\nKathleen Tyson",

        "description": "Fantastic fun Wordsmiths meeting last night on Ready, Write, Action! For the first time there was still daylight when we met upstairs at the Thames Court. We welcomed new member Alison, who then rescued my reading from the Cloud with her IT help desk skills.\n\nDavid had challenged us to write an action scene and most of us came prepared. Some of us reworked something we'd written earlier and others made up entirely new stories. The readings ranged from the hilariously comic to tense emotional confrontation to bloodthirsty knifing.\n\nDavid read a teasing scene of film set mishaps descending seaward toward tragedy.\nGerry gave a hilarious account of 'The Humphrey Bogart' passenger he picked up - and pushed in - at Elephant & Castle in his cab.\nRosina combined the familiar waiting room of a garage with the Adults Only column of Exchange & Mart to surprising effect.\nPaula gave us a taxi crash and tense dark impending threat that followed.\nKaren read bitter recriminations and wounding words and blows between husband and wife from her novel.\nGuy read a surprising reaction to litter in a Shepperton park in 'Bob and Yob' with a sting in it.\nAfter some initial IT issues, I read young Godwin's vengeance against the first Saxon he meets after discovering his dead family.\n\nDavid's challenge for our next meeting is use of simile and metaphor. Will we compose like Lord Byron or are we with Ogden Nash? I blaze with writing ambition like a Viking beacon!\n\nGrammarly Tutorial: https://www.grammarly.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-simile-and-a-metaphor/\n\nVERY LIKE A WHALE by Ogden Nash\n\nOne thing that literature would be greatly the better for\nWould be a more restricted employment by authors of simile and\nmetaphor.\nAuthors of all races, be they Greeks, Romans, Teutons or Celts,\nCan't seem just to say that anything is the thing it is but have to\ngo out of their way to say that it is like something else.\nWhat does it mean when we are told\nThat that Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold?\nIn the first place, George Gordon Byron had enough experience\nTo know that it probably wasn't just one Assyrian, it was a lot of\nAssyrians.\nHowever, as too many arguments are apt to induce apoplexy and\nthus hinder longevity,\nWe'll let it pass as one Assyrian for the sake of brevity.\nNow then, this particular Assyrian, the one whose cohorts were\ngleaming in purple and gold,\nJust what does the poet mean when he says he came down like a\nwolf on the fold?\nIn heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophy\nthere are great many things.\nBut I don't imagine that among them there is a wolf with purple\nand gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings.\nNo, no, Lord Byron, before I'll believe that this Assyrian was\nactually like a wolf I must have some kind of proof.\nDid he run on all fours and did he have a hairy tail and a big red\nmouth and big white teeth and did he say Woof Woof?\nFrankly I think it is very unlikely, and all you were entitled to say,\nat the very most,\nWas that the Assyrian cohorts came down like a lot of Assyrian\ncohorts about to destroy the Hebrew host.\nBut that wasn't fancy enough for Lord Byron, oh dear me no, he\nhad to invent a lot of figures of speech and then interpolate them,\nWith the result that whenever you mention Old Testament soldiers\nto people they say Oh yes, they're the ones that a lot of\nwolves dressed up in gold and purple ate them.\nThat's the kind of thing that's being done all the time by poets,\nfrom Homer to Tennyson;\nThey're always comparing ladies to lilies and veal to venison,\nAnd they always say things like that the snow is a white blanket\nafter a winter storm.\nOh it is, is it? All right then, you sleep under a six-inch blanket of\nsnow and I'll sleep under a half-inch blanket of unpoetical\nblanket material and we'll see which one keeps warm.\nAnd after that maybe you'll begin to comprehend dimly\nWhat I mean by too much metaphor and simile.",

        "description": "First, many thanks to Paul and the team at the Thames Court Pub for giving us such a great meeting venue. As the weather warms and the evenings lengthen, Paul has assured me that Shepperton Wordsmiths can continue to use the upstairs room on alternate Tuesdays into the summer.\n\nLast Tuesday, keeping to David's challenge, we offered pieces of writing composed as or with simile or metaphor. I opened with \"Moon River\", an account of the final song and final days of a neighbour who passed away recently. David kept the fatal theme but lightened the tone considerably with his story recounting a series of hilarious crematorium mishaps. Guy kept the dark comedy going with a reading from his book Tapestry: \"You're fired.\" Karen took us deep into her wardrobe and the magic of memory we all experience when viewing or touching something we rarely wear but can't discard. Paula gave us a pacy account of middle-age marathon running inspired by new running shoes. Gerry took us on a joyous taxi ride from The Westbury Hotel to The Cumberland Hotel with a working girl who claimed it was \"the ride of her life.\" Rosina entertained us with Hoover, the aptly-named dog who eats everything. Mike enchanted us with a tour through London that snaked along a surprising yet familiar route.\n\nDavid then challenged us to count similes and metaphors in a \"trivial piece of nonsense\" he wrote while not writing what he intended (Guy and I counted 21).\n\nNEXT MEETING:\n\nAs an exercise for the next meeting I thought we might each try to frame an idea in three different ways to demonstrate the power of showing rather than telling. When I first showed my fiction writing to another author a few years back, he immediately handed it back and said, “Show, don’t tell.” Ouch!\n\nWhat he meant was that I lost him as a reader by starting my book with a detailed background explanation rather than bringing the detail out as action or dialogue driving a story with characters that drew him into the scene.\n\nFrom p. 43 of author and editor Sol Stein's \"Stein On Writing\":\n_____________________\nDescription is a depiction of a locale or person. The Latin root of the word \"depiction,\" pingere, means \"to picture\" or to fashion a visual image.\n\nNarrative Summary is the recounting of what happens offstage, out of the reader's sight and hearing, a scene is told rather than shown.\n\nAn Immediate Scene happens in front of the reader, is visible, and therefore filmable. That's an important test. If you can't film a scene, it is not immediate. Theatre, a truly durable art, consists almost entirely of immediate scenes.\n\nJust as every form of writing that is expected to be read with pleasure moves away from abstraction, every form of pleasurable writing benefits from conveying as much as possible before the eye, onstage rather than offstage.\n_______________________\n\nEither working with a scene you’ve already written, or with a new idea for a scene, just try writing it in alternative versions, as a Description, then as a Narrative Summary, then as an Immediate Scene. Now that I know the difference, I try to drive my stories through the power of Immediate Scenes, keeping the reader engaged even if they don’t always have a complete grasp of all the detailed background and context I might think important. As Rosina commented during discussion, \"The curious card is the one you cannot see.\" Authors always know more than readers; so long as there is action and pace, a few curious gaps will be forgiven sooner than too much descriptive detail.\n\nI've put a couple \"Show, Don't Tell\" worksheets online: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pEtKpQScdQuJt_s-z7wvWS2UdLDBNJcP?usp=sharing",

        "description": "The exercise for our last meeting was to write the same scene from three different perspectives: description, narrative, and immediate scene. David found this one challenging, but eventually started on it by imagining an oil painting depicting a cruel sea captain, then narrated the same scene from the perspective of a crewman, then made the scene come alive with immediacy as the cruel captain ordered a flogged seaman dragged to him while his mates were ordered to trim the sails. I followed by prosaicly describing a sunning cat, narrating its leap to a lock gate, and then showing its outstretched claws digging into the hot, sun-baked black paint as it stretched its length along the arm of the gate to take in the heat. Paula gave us an escalating intensity account of limping into a convenience store to find herself painfully obstructed and delayed by a scratch-card customer at the till. Mike also read us a piece, but it must have been so enthralling that I forgot to take notes!\n\nNot each of us writes these exercises, and that's just fine. There are no rules. Nothing is obligatory. No one gets graded. I find doing the exercises makes me more conscious of alternative choices I make when I'm writing, which hopefully makes my writing more powerful over time. Some Wordsmiths choose not to do them. It's always your choice.\n\nWe welcomed Mandy and Judy as 1st timers in the Wordsmiths, and hope they'll come again.\n\nMoving on to readings, Jerry applied his 6th sense of reading characters from the drivers' seat of his cab to recount the antics of a purse-pinching cheapskate. Guy rounded off our readings with an excerpt from his account of a convert terrorist driven by disillusionment and an emptiness of motivation and meaning in his life. I read a bit more of my Viking saga, as they torched a chapel before fleeing by boat.\n\nAGENDA: I hadn't come up with an exercise for the next meeting by the time we adjourned, but serendipity has solved my problem. This morning I found a single page from a book burned around all four edges on my garden path. As we've recently lost two houses to fire just up the island, it's probably blown over from one of them. I thought as an exercise we could take the scene from the singed page as a starting point, and each write a further paragraph or two filling out the scene or what happened after. The margin on the right is burned off, so you'll have to fill in a few words. The page is the featured picture above.\n\nAfter we read our expansions on the fragment, we'll move on to our own readings as usual.",

        "description": "The Burned Book exercise we wrote for the last meeting was extremely telling about the different approaches we take as members of the group, and revealed a surprise gender divide. The fragment which each writer keyed off to extend the story had a man and woman separating after she dropped him at his car. The first two continuations, by David and Jerry, both involved car chases and violent crashes. The continuations by Karen, Paula and me explored the emotions of lust, guilt and shame hinted at by the woman. Maybe the perfect novel would combine them!\n\nMike didn't make it to this meeting, but did write the Burning Book exercise so might read it next time. He also asked to read ours. I offered to email our exercises to him, but it's probably simpler to just bring your printed Burned Book story to give him at the next meeting.\n\nFollowing on, Guy read an extract from his non-fiction essay on American identity, settlement, and geographic expansion. We don't read much non-fiction, but as I write more history than fiction, I think it's okay to mix it up if that's what we write.\n\nGuy's excerpt led to a discussion that ranged about a bit, ending when Linda suggested that for the next meeting we write something brief on the theme of the Wild West. She's a big fan of the old classic movies when good guys wore white hats and shot straight, and bad guys always got their comeuppance.\n\nSo that's the plan, and I'm up for it. If you feel inspired, write something short from the Wild West genre. The picture above is me and my sons at Delicate Arch in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah. My dad took us on camping holidays in the high dessert every other year when I was growing up, and I love the landscape as much as the narratives of pilgrim settlement and cowboys & indians. The picture above is from the first Western holiday with my dad and boys in 2004. John Wayne liked the scenery so much he bought himself a ranch on the Colorado River just outside Moab.\n\nWe continued the readings with a fragment I've written that will go somewhere in my Godwin novel called 'Soulseer', when Godwin captures and enslaves a Saxon noblewoman on the shores of the combe taken from him as a boy. Gerry followed that with a New Year's Eve story from the driver's seat of his cab, and a particularly unwelcome demand for a kiss from a drunken fare. David gave us a ghostly ambition to spread spookiness on social media. And Mandy rounded off the readings with a heart-rending introduction to Phoebe the Dog, the adventurous hero of her childrens' books. Delightful!\n\nGiddyup, partners! Join us upstairs in the Thames Court Saloon when we take aim at the Wild West next time.",

        "description": "The speed at which time elapses is accelerating as the year progresses! Apologies for not getting this invitation up sooner, but the past 10 days have sped by in a blur. The Wild West exercise at the last meeting was an amazing success. David gave us a brave sherriff and boy challenging Black Jack at the saloon. Karen had us making a paper headdress and playing cowboys and indians in the garden, but \"being a girl, I had to be rescued a lot\". Guy raised the tone with a history of American expansion and imperialism, displacing and dispossessing Native Americans. I read a little piece about a cowboy trapped by bad guys up an arroyo. Paula gave us an insight into her family history, as her Uncle Joe settled on an Indian reservation in New Mexico as a clerk and met a bad end after challenging the systematic oppression and corruption of the government. Mike took us on air with Country 1035AM, stetsons, line dancing, and the ambitions of young Susie & Johnny to open a themed restaurant. Gerry gave us a humerous parable about Old Sam and his horse. Mike then rounded this off with a reversion to our previous exercise, reading his expansion on the burned book fragment to take it to a dark place and explosive ending.\n\nWe agreed next Tuesday we'll try to have a tutorial on KDP self-publishing if we can get the technology to work. Either David or I will have our laptop there to get online, project to the film screen, and walk you through how KDP organises itself to let you publish your work as a printed book.",

        "description": "Last meeting we welcomed Peter to his first meeting, and were glad to see Mandy return too. The demo of KDP Self-Publishing went pretty well, followed by Readings from Karen, Jerry, Rosina and David. Karen shared her impressions of 1989 pre-supression Tiananmen Square. Jerry gave us another comic spin in his cab as he stalked fares during a slowdown in trade. Rosina livened up the Shepperton Village Fair with cowboys and magic. David spooked us with the potential for characters to migrate from our imaginations to our dreams to controlling and destroying our lives. Yikes!\n\nWe've had ongoing discussion in the Wordsmiths about whether writers need to follow rules, some rules, no rules, all the time, some of the time, when they feel like it, only after the 2nd G&T, on alternate Saturdays, etc.\n\nJust for fun I'm going to point you this week at Tom McAllister's '107 Ironclad Rules for Writers Who Want to Be Better at Writing': http://www.tom.mcallister.ws/blog/2016/6/19/107-ironclad-rules-for-writers-who-want-to-be-better-at-writing\n\nThese rules are mostly silly, but I found them funny and often thought-provoking. Tom says, \"My whole teaching philosophy is built around giving accidentally good advice between making bad jokes.\"\n\nAnyway, if you want an assignment for next Tuesday's MeetUp then pick three of these Rules and tell us why we should follow them, not follow them, or at least think about them.\n\nFor example, \"Rule 79. Never kill a dog in your book. The dogs will know.\" What about cats? Cats rule the Internet! When the 21st century is looked back on 1000 years from now, humans will be seen as cat worshippers and cat-servants. Therefore it must be more important not to offend cats. They will probably rule the society that writes about the past in the future.\n\nAnd then more Readings!\n\nUnless I hear otherwise from you I'll book the British Library outing for the Making Your Mark Exhibition on writing for Tuesday, 23rd July, late morning (11:00-ish). If there is a rail strike I can drive us in and park just a block from the Library in a private lot I have liberty to use. Please confirm if you want a ticket as I'll try to get a group rate.",

        "description": "We started the last meeting of Wordsmiths by celebrating the publication of two books by our authors: 'Believe Me' by Paula and 'The Kambatan' by Guy. Well done!\n\nWe also welcomed Dan to his first meeting.\n\nKaren told the Group about the Curtis Brown 1st Novel Prize which is open for entries of 1st novels until noon on 1st August. Submission requires a 10,000 words of your book and a 400 word synopsis. Even if you don't think you'll win, it might be a good exercise for novelists to read the requirements for this publisher and try to write a synopsis to their recommendations. Details are here: https://www.curtisbrowncreative.co.uk/first-novel-prize/\n\nWe then discussed Tom McAllister's '107 Ironclad Rules for Writers Who Want to Be Better at Writing': http://www.tom.mcallister.ws/blog/2016/6/19/107-ironclad-rules-for-writers-who-want-to-be-better-at-writing. These are tongue-in-cheek rules, but they made us think a bit.\n\nMandy offered her own rule: 'Create your characters and then let them loose. Don't keep them on a short leash.' A good rule for an author who relies on her dog Phoebe getting into new scrapes for her stories!\n\nFor the next meeting, I thought we'd go back to craft and discuss plot. Above is a photo I took of a poster at Shepperton Studios Career Fair on Thursday from someone who advises on plot development for film scripts. I thought it might be useful to the Worsmiths. I can only display part of the photo in the header for MeetUp but the whole photo and complete list are on the Wordsmith G-Drive. I've also put there Guy's list of 'Some Tips for Aspiring Writers'. Everything is here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pEtKpQScdQuJt_s-z7wvWS2UdLDBNJcP\n\n5 Wordsmiths said they wanted to joint the British Library outing on 23rd July for the 'Making Your Mark' exhibition. Full price tickets are £14 and senior tickets are £12. If we go for 11:30 train entry we might be able to get Super Off-Peak fares at Shepperton Station and save a bit on train travel. I'll confirm arrangements and bookings on Tuesday with those going, or email me if you are missing the meeting Tuesday.\n\nThat should be enough to start conversation before Readings. See you then!",

We did have a very good discussion of plot development and characterisation. And then when we gave our readings there was more careful analysis and structured critique, which each of us found useful.\n\nI decided to submit 'Godwin the Sealord' to the Curtis Brown first novel competition that Karen brought to our attention, so I read my 400 word summary. Guy, David and Mandy made some very good plotting suggestions which I'm integrating into the revised summary.\nhttps://www.curtisbrowncreative.co.uk/first-novel-prize/\n\nFor the pre-meeting exercise on Tuesday I recommend you read a blogpost from 2013 by Arlene Prunkl on 'How to professionally format your manuscript for editors, agents, and publishers'. It taught me very many things I did not know. I'm using it to format Godwin now.\nhttp://penultimateword.com/editing-blogs/how-to-professionally-format-your-manuscript-for-editors-agents-publishers/\n\nDavid and Rosina have also invited a neighbour of ours to Wordsmiths who has just had her first novel published and distributed throughout the UK. It has already sold out in Waterstones and WH Smiths! Congratulations, Elizabeth!

        "description": "We had an exciting meeting of Wordsmiths on 30th July, welcoming a neighbour from the Island who has published a best seller first novel this summer and just submitted a sequel for publication next year. Elizabeth started her career in acting, and from what she said the ability to write to order and take direction from her agent and publisher were very important to her success. Acting also gave her an ear for dialogue. Her novel 'Liverpool Girl' has already sold out at Waterstones and WH Smith, and has 5 stars on Amazon.co.uk. Rosina has read it already and says it kicks along at a great pace - 'a real page-turner'.\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Liverpool-Girl-Elizabeth-Morton/dp/1529103525/\n\nI've always leaned toward the view that although writing is a solitary pursuit getting published requires acts of collective will and collaboration. Elizabeth originally won a short story contest with the premise of her novel, and then rewrote it as a longer book at the suggestion of an agent at the award ceremony. Her agent then asked her to set it in the 1950s instead of the 1970s as more commercially marketable. The publisher then gave it a slant toward 'Call the Midwife' and put a baby on the cover, though there is no baby in the book. When Elizabeth queried this - mind you, not objecting - she was told \"babies sell better than bumps\". Publishers know their market! Her advice to us is to go along with advice you're given so as not to be seen as precious and difficult to work with.\n\nImportantly, Elizabeth made it clear she was not an overnight success. She has been writing for television and submitting short stories to contests for decades. Her success comes after a lot of hard work and determination, and even some discouragement. Well done!\n\nIn member readings Gerry gave us an unusally saucy account of a pick up from a club near Smithfield Market, Guy gave us a retrospective assessment of US presidents Nixon, Carter and Reagan, and Karen a lovely, evocative jazz session in a smoke-filled grass hut with Pepe's paella on Timpana Island.\n\nFor Tuesday, if you're up for a spooky challenge, Guy suggested we write ghost stories. David has the advantage of us here, as he writes ghost stories quite a bit already, but the rest of us might try our hands - or keyboards - at something ethereal from the other light.",

        "description": "What an amazing meeting we had 13th August on 'Ghost Stories'! Eight Wordsmiths brough ghost stories they had composed on the theme, and Guy - who proposed the theme - will read his at the next meeting.\n\nWe started the meeting with a bit of improvised comedy that neighbour Gordon from the Island wanted to try out. We gave him our feedback and learned some lessons ourselves about the importance of projection, timing and comedic effect.\n\nThen we read our marvellous ghost stories. David gave us a pickpocket in purgatory. Gerry's taxi was hailed by a spirit to pick up his widow from her annual trip to a medium at the Spiritualist Society. Mandy gave us a shooting at Berkeley Hall. I infused my plum jam with a little spirit. Rosina revived her magician in a new story, evoking the scent of 'mown grass, mint and wild thyme'. Mike's silent oarsman rowed passengers Ross and McPherson across a misty river, but only one arrived on the opposite shore. Karen brought the spirit of RLS down the mountain path from his graveside on Mount Vaea to the home he once rented. Each story was different and quite wonderful. I'm proud of us all for rising to the challenge!\n\nNext Tuesday we'll be treated to another performance as Paula and David will read Paula's Trotsky play.\n\nThen we'll have another KDP tutorial, this time on uploading covers for KDP published books either as paperbacks or as kindle ebooks.\n\nThen, of course, more readings from the works that each of us is pushing forward with this summer.\n\nFinally, I'm illustrating this invitation with a 1945 Dorothy Parker telegram published this week by Nicholas Thompson, editor of my favourite magazine Wired. It proves that even the wittiest and best writers can stumble and lose spirit from time to time. At least with Wordsmiths we have each other to cheer us up and cheer us on.",

        "description": "We started our last meeting with a discussion of how covers can be created in KDP for self-published books and ebooks. While we weren't able to help Karen with all her technical challenges, we were successful in in finding a potential title for her biofiction about Robert Louis Stevenson from one of his quotes: \"Life is not a matter of holding good cards, but of playing a poor hand well.\" This echoes a lot of the drama from her book, so maybe 'Playing A Poor Hand Well' will be her title.\n\nWe were next treated to Guy's ghost story. It was an evocative piece, telling of curiousity, temptation, restraint, capitulation, copulation, and then fear. Poor Adam!\n\nNext Paula and David did a staged reading of her short play evoking the ghost of Leon Trotsky in 1941, a year after his Murder in Mexico City. It was a problematic piece, projecting onto a man who rejected identity as a Jew an urgent obligation to write in defence of Jews as if his posthumous acceptance of the obligation half a world away would have mattered. He says, \"Jew is not a category I recognise,\" but is hounded to reconsider.

Four instances were identified in which a stereotype can be employed to useful effect.\n\nAnd so that takes us to the (purely optional) homework which has been set as “a short story that invokes a stereotype and then unexpectedly blasts it to bits”.\n\nHappy writing!",

        "description": "We started the meeting on 24/09 with reviewing alternative cover designs for Karen's biofiction novel on Robert Louis Stevenson. She's changed the title again and had various alternative covers, some busy, some plain. What came through in the discussion was the importance of clear text and fonts, especially if there is a complex background image. It also matters who you are targeting as readers, men or women, in designing the cover.\n\nWe went on to the exercise of sterotype busting. Some sterotyping is useful if you think it will help the reader move along with the story, but the risk is profiling that is unnecessary and does not progress the plot. Karen gave us a short story in Eden where Eve is dynamic, brave and embraces her sexuality while Adam is timid, shy and threatened. Lovely! Guy gave us the cat Asterix who was a part of his family for more than 15 years, ceding place to successors Hannah and Brodie. Mandy gave us an gentle and delightful story of a career woman in London misjudging a homeless man. My favourite line: \"I think you are still everything you used to be.\" Rosina rounded off the stories with 'Sweetie the Lap Cat'.\n\nWe agreed the topic for discussion next Tuesday could be marketing a self-published book, but since that is exactly what I'll be doing I won't be with you. I'm giving my talk on '1066: The Siege, Surrender and Triumph of London' to the London & Middlesex Archaeological Society at the Clore Centre, Museum of London, 150 London Wall, London EC2Y 5HN, 6pm for 6:30 talk. Cost £3 if you would like to come along. I'll be flogging the book after the event.\n\nDavid will deputise again with Wordsmiths on Tuesday. He'd like to start with the Radio 4 Money Box show from February 'The economics of being an author'. He will play the recording downloaded to prompt the discussion afterwards.\n\nAnd then more readings from those who have them! Have fun and wish me luck!",

        "description": "To start the 8th October meeting we listened to a BBC Moneybox phone-in programme entitled “The Economics of being an Author” which featured a panel comprising a literary agent and some fulltime authors who shared their experiences. The resulting discussion covered such topics as transiting from other, fulltime paid work to writing as a career, earnings levels, the value of using a literary agent, self-publishing, audiobooks and unbound.com (a crowdfunding publisher).\n\nFollowing this we discussed the necessity and methods of marketing one’s own self-published work and the desirability of using one or more of Instagram, Facebook and Twitter et al as major components in the marketing mix. There emerged a distinct lack of enthusiasm about such use and the general view about these applications was that whilst they appeared to be necessary for promoting one’s work they should be employed with full awareness and a degree of caution.\n\nGerry then read us a memoir which featured a male passenger with a very rude and superior manner and accompanied by a lady whom he was most probably trying to impress demanding to be taken to the Savoy. As we know London cabbies are renowned for their wit and Gerry’s immediate and questioning riposte, delivered with both courtesy and wit was nevertheless sufficient to have the lady laugh out loud whilst at the same time delivering a portion of humiliation to her unpleasant partner. The journey terminated at the Savoy and as might be expected Gerry only received the “Legal” (metered) recompense for the trip and was no doubt only too happy to be denied the customary tip in this instance. Thus we are reminded that we reap what we sow!\n\nGuy then read an extract from his book “The Bigger Picture” which argues that there is a fundamental truth about the nature of things and an interplay between them. Climatic conditions and events in history (environmental disasters, wars, the industrial revolution, the reformation, for example) are bound by nexus and a change in one condition will instigate change in others and in that way affect decision making and the direction of the development of civilisations.\n\nFor those interested in doing some homework before our next meeting the topic suggested by Mandy and approved by the assembly was “Childhood” and so stories must include a child, but they can of course be autobiographical, semi-autobiographical or pure fiction.\n\nAs David has deputised for Kathleen as host twice now, he's been added as a host also to the MeetUp group, enabling him to administer the webgroup.",

It was just David, Rosina, Mandy and me, but we were all in a sociable mood and delighted to hear Mandy's account of the Bath Literary Festival.\n\nI thought Festivals would be a good topic to discuss on Tuesday. They can certainly be a great source for candid feedback, advice about agents, and inspiration to get on with your writing. I've been to a writers' festival at Leeds and Mandy has just been to Bath. I'll do a little prep work on what goes on at festivals and how you can make the most of them as an aspiring author.\n\nI'll also bring a list of literary festivals and dates for 2020. The 2019 season is just ending this week, so we should be looking ahead. Perhaps we will find a festival that a few of us want to go to together next year and we can organise a bit to get ourselves and our writing ready in advance.\n\nOne of the many things I'm proud of with Shepperton Wordsmiths is how we have begun to collaborate and help each other, beyond the meetings. Very little in life of any importance is achieved by solitary effort. A little teamwork and practical support can go a long way in giving each other confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nAs it will be Bonfire Night, perhaps we will see some fireworks from our room upstairs at the Thames Court!",

        "description": "At the 5th November meeting we enjoyed some very nearby fireworks, seemingly a fusillade directed at the Thames Court, and a lively discussion of the calendar of UK literary festivals which extends from June to November. After reviewing the list of top UK festivals near and far, we agreed that we might try to go to the Cliveden Literary Festival in 2020. Cliveden is fairly near so we wouldn't need hotels (20 miles from Shepperton) and the festival offers a broad scope. I've registered our interest with the organisers and will follow up with the Wordsmiths when the dates are announced and as the 2020 agenda fills out.\n\nThe 2019 Cliveden Literary Festival was a good mix of the types of writing we do in Shepperton Wordsmiths: Novels, Poetry, History, Politics, War and Spies. No children's topics this year, but perhaps there will be next year.\nhttp://clivedenliteraryfestival.org/programme/\n\nSince Mandy and I have each found festivals motivating and inspiring, I thought we might discuss at the next meeting Tuesday, 19th November, how to get the most out of the festival experience. Usually there are chances for writing clinics, meetings with agents and editors, and other opportunities to get helpful feedback on your work, but you get the most profit from these if you prepare before the event. I'll try to have a word with the organisers on how best to prepare for Cliveden so we can discuss it Tuesday evening. Mandy can supplement with insights from her experience at the Bath Children's Literary Festival.\n\nFor readings at the last meeting Guy asked for feedback on his brief history of the founding of Israel. He regretted Paula wasn't there for insight. I read the first few pages of a novel I started in 2013 - a narrowboat thriller intended to be pacy at 4 miles per hour. I'll read a bit more next time too.",

        "description": "Another small but fun meeting of Wordsmiths on Tuesday. Attending were Mandy, David and Karen. Following up on the previous meeting, when we decided we might try the Clivedon Literary Festival in 2020, I reported on my contact with the organisers. Unlike the writers' festivals that I attended in York and Mandy attended in Guildford, Clivedon offers no workshops, no tutorials, no one-on-one with author or agents, and is limited in its agenda to famous authors talking to the audience from the stage. This doesn't really fit with the Wordsmith ethos. Instead I researched other options.\n\nInstead of Clivedon I put forward that we might attend the National Association of Writers' Groups (NAWG) Festival 2020.\n\nThe 2020 programme is not online yet, but the 2019 agenda remains up for review. It includes speakers, workshops, themed seminars, and meetings with agents and publishers. Also, it is much more broadly scoped to embrace travel writing, poetry, crime fiction, romantic novels, etc. I have subscribed to the mailing list and will keep you all updated as more information comes through.\n\nhttps://www.nawg.co.uk/nawgfest-2019\n\nKaren elaborated on her own travel writing ambitions, regaling us with an account of her participation in a Tahitian beer night ritual which was sort of oriented to 'last man standing'.\n\nNo one else had brought readings so I read the opening of Safari Club again, as none of the the three had been at the previous meeting. That brings everyone up to the same point if I continue the work going forward.\n\nFor the next meeting there is interest in finding a way to do some chained collaborative writing, passing a work forward through the group from some starting point, to see where it ends up after serial contributions. This might be done through Google Drive, but not everyone has a gmail account so we'll have to discuss it more for practicalities.\n\nAs an opening topic for the Wordsmiths' next meeting, I thought I would introduce a short work from Autocrit (an online editing application available by free subscription for now) on Three Red Flags that often mean failure with agents. The lessons are short and to the point, and I found them helpful.\n\nI've uploaded a PDF to the Google Drive using the following link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1yJxg2evlFt5BzBtRjbQI2P0D7Yn2n7hk\n\nAnd bring some Readings!",

I used the holidays to crank out 25 pages on global financial stability reform, which I will NOT be reading to the Wordsmiths as it is for a very niche audience.\n\nThanks again to Rosina for hosting our first Christmas Party at Toad Hall. Quite a few of us showed up and all but two had written Christmas ghost stories to share. They were so amazing I was captivated. I didn't even take notes, except for Rosina's story which came first. As usual she engages our imaginary senses with oozing mud, a wood fire, howling winds, and glowing eyes, before carrying the story of Mad Cat and Dog to its eerie conclusion at Shepperton Lock.\n\nNew Wordsmith David has volunteered to come up with an excercise for our first meeting of 2020, so kudos to him for stepping forward! I'm always grateful for help and ideas.\n\nAlso, we've been invited to write about 300 words for Shepperton News about Wordsmiths to gen up some new members. Have a think about what that might look like for discussion on Tuesday. And if Wordsmiths want to contribute short stories for the neighbourhood to enjoy, the editor would welcome more regular contributions.\n\nHoping you all had lovely holidays and wishing you literary productivity to share with us in 2020!",

If there have been disagreements, they have been good natured and addressed with tolerance and respect.\n\nAnd we have accomplishments! Guy has published two books, 'The Kambatan Assignment' (June 2019) and 'Facing the End: Why it is not crazy to believe the Second Coming is imminent' (November 2019).\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=guy+blythman\nKaren has published her biofiction of Robert Louis Stevenson as 'The Love Affair' (December 2019). As Karen told us on 7th January holding the hardcopy proudly, \"I couldn't have done it without Shepperton Wordsmiths; it would still be sitting in a drawer.\"\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-Affair-karen-steele/dp/1695574710/\nWell done, both of you!\n\nI failed my own objective of finishing my novel, but I've had fun along the way. A little failure is good for the soul, endowing humility and deeper appreciation of others' achievements. I've written lots of good stuff in 2019, some of it published, some not, some for work, some for fun, but all of it better for the lessons we've learned together.\n\nAt the last meeting we did two exercises proposed by new member David-2, as I think of him. The first was a scene-setting view of a seaside town that's known better days. David-2 read his own introduction of Ilfracombe that starts his biofiction. Several others of us read our own views of seaside squalor. The scond was brainstorming plots for Dr Who. Guy revealed a massive history of writing for the Dr Who fanzine, three novels, a beastiary, and various plot proposals. What an unsuspected gold mine of Who-ology!\n\nFor our next meeting I'd like to discuss method of critique, which means how we can best frame our commentary on each other's work to be useful and relevant. I've copied a really good set of Rules of Critique I found online to the Google Drive that we can read before the next meeting, and then discuss together. The link is here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PhC4loFL2xOfMYZhXG6pU6yU5096KJ5z\n\nAnd, of course, bring along some writing to read to us so that we can put into practice the wisdom we acquire.\n\nSee you next Tuesday at the Thames Court!",

        "description": "We had a really good discussion of the Rules of Critique at the 21/01/20 meeting. (Wordsmith drive link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PhC4loFL2xOfMYZhXG6pU6yU5096KJ5z)\n\nRosina had the inspiration to try to apply the method of critique to the winning short stories from the Exeter short story competition (previously won by our neighbour Elizabeth some years ago). She noted that all winning stories were very well written, with good follow through, and each had a little surprise for the reader.\n\nKaren read us a bit of of Diane Setterfield's 'Once Upon A River' about how blokes in a pub celebrated the variety and use of new words, stretching each other as collectors of words. It sounds so charming that I've ordered my own copy of this best-selling novel: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Once-Upon-River-Diane-Setterfield/dp/1784163635/\n\nWingman David told us how he likes to set a scene by bringing multiple senses into play in the reader's mind, then drive right into the action with the active voice and some emotional engagement. He had reworked his 400 word story 'Nearly Christmas' to add a mother in the house, and it charmed us all this time when he read it for us.\n\nGerry read us his own words of wisdom on criticism. It begins: \"Criticising, a minefield of opinion, explosive egos, feelings, hopes, ambitions, prejudices, preferences, grievances, grudges, and perhaps not in equal measure, genuine goodwill and admiration for a good work or performance.\" The whole thing is worth re-reading, though it won't be as good without Gerry's narration! I've scanned the half page and added it to our Wordsmith Drive here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S9odzzzjnrj_SZNzPZB_bJB4RV7wPl13\n\nGuy gave us some history of Angles, Saxons and Normans. I always enjoy a new perspective on Alfred (Saxon), Aethelstan (Anglo-Danish), and William the Conqueror. His history emphasised the mongrel nature of an early England that emerged from serial migrations and conquests to coalesce in the medieval era as a young nation with its own imperial ambitions and its own wide-ranging mercantile sea army.\n\nDavid-2 gave us the beginning of a 'Christmas Ghost' where Steve advances from the windy shore of Ilfracombe into an abandonned hotel where 'memories are broken and painful'.\n\nWe agreed at the next meeting to review Wingman David's checklist for editing short stories. I've put in in the Wordsmith Drive here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1C0hHSeFShtkgpDIMKDoBHr5gVhu68308\n\nSee you Tuesday!",

        "description": "We had a good discussion of Wingman's Short Story Checklist (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S9odzzzjnrj_SZNzPZB_bJB4RV7wPl13). The key takeaways are:\n- Has the story been read aloud?\n- Engage with a strong opening sentence\n- Ground the reader's experience in their 5 senses\n- Use pacing to move the story along\n- Convey a unique voice\n\nWingman and Mike then gave a reading of 'The Algorithm Trap', an attempt to raise awareness of the receding role of human agency and human control as Big Data and complex technologies gain more and more leverage over our experience of the world, and they never forget anything about us with the aim of ever higher profits, executive bonuses and share prices. \"Yeah, crazy world, innit?\"\n\nMike then shared 'half a story' which teased us by weaving our diverse Wordsmith interests together as a very clever tapestry: out of season seaside, ghost, a cat named Max, music, romance, looming violence and jealousy, and a windswept esplanade after 'Max the Sax and Carrie the Canay clicked' . . . MORE PLEASE! The characterisation, cadence and pace were thrilling.\n\nGuy gave us his long trailed essay on Trump and Obama. 'Yes We Can! No, we couldn't.' Both compromised American values and political identity, if in very different ways.\n\nDavid2 gave us more James Allen biofiction from Illfracombe, this time featuring dialogue as his character Bill quotes Allen in conversation: \"Actions and circumstances will follow your thoughts. Master your thoughts and you can do anything.\"\n\nNext time I thought we should discuss how technology is adapting to support complex writing. Wired Magazine (one of the best written journals there is anywhere) pointed me to a new writing app aimed at complex fictional worlds, developed by a writer 'to scratch is own itch'. Have a look at Granthika: https://granthika.co/\n\nI hope David2 will also tell us more about the app he uses for his writing, and that others will share their technology experiences.\n\nSee you upstairs at the Thames Court, Tuesday!",

Even with fires and floods and plagues she loved it there! David enthused about a 'flash writing' competition which gave him an award just for waiting until the last minute to make his submission.\n\nI'm afraid the rest of the evening is a bit of a blur. Rosina and I had spent all day in a mediation with the Countil over the parking dispute at Shepperton Lock and we were exhausted. I wrote something to read, but ended up deciding to save it for the next meeting.\n\nWhat I'll be reading is rather special. It is an account from life of a rather surprising discovery that made local news.\n\nAs an exercise for the next meeting I thought we all might bring something we wrote from a life experience. I know it will be a broad range from the lot of us, given some of the life-inspired writings shared at previous gatherings. Ghosts, travels, cats, and so much more.\n\nThe Christmas Party was such a success we decided to have another social event on the Island when the weather warms. Bring your diaries on Tuesday so we can decide a date for a boat trip on Diona followed by croquet and barbeque on the Green.\n\nAnd watch for the next Shepperton News. David sent a story which has gone forward to the editor. No feedback yet, but fingers crossed.",

Mike tried to get in but I must not have seen him in the virtual waiting room. I'll try to do better!\n\nFew of us seem to be taking advantage of Lock Down to write much. I know I'm not. But perhaps if we encourage each other, we'll get back up to pace.\n\nWe've decide to have another Zoom Meetup on Tuesday, 26th May, at the usual time of 19:30. Zoom could have cut us off at 40 minutes as I've got the free account so far, but actually gave us as much time as we wanted. We'll test that generosity again next week!\n\nIt was fascinating to see everyone in their homes rather than around the table at the Thames Court. As a writing exercise for next week the proposal agreed was to write 1000 words more or less about an object in the background on Zoom. If this is your home, it may be an object in the background with meaning to you. As I've got pretty full shelves behind me, I'll have to think on that one.\n\nJames showed us his Zoom proficiency by switching to a rainforest then a woodland background. If you prefer to switch backgrounds, write a story suitable for the one chosen.\n\nHere's a blog post on how easy it is to switch backgrounds and offering some images:\nhttps://www.owllabs.com/blog/zoom-virtual-background\n\nSee you next Tuesday!",

        "description": "Our Zoom Wordsmiths is growing! We had five (Karen, David, Rosina, Guy and myself) on the last Zoom meeting, and very friendly it was too. Karen gave us a tour around her sitting room, with polar bears, RLS books and an oriental desk. Guy read an amazing piece of 'flash fiction' with \"Death by Writers Workshop\" that referenced some of us had me reaching for the carving knife and duct tape. Rosina showed us the brass 'lucky miner's shoe' match holders from her mantle that remind her of a happy interval of kindness and simplicity as a little girl. David gave us the origins and history of the fabulous rug hanging behind his desk that he found in a skip, used to cushion his knees for oil changes for 10 years, then took for expert cleaning to find it was valued amongst his treasures. I shared my adventures in Iraq in 2003. Then we just chatted as the time fled away. Zoom was once again gracious enough to ignore the 40 minute limit on my free plan.\n\nIf Zoom ever does cut us off, I will schedule a further meeting for 5 minutes afterwards, and immediately send around an invite. In the event, check your emails.\n\nLast year a house tragically burnt down on Hamhaugh Island. A few weeks later a single page of burnt book landed on my front path, blown there by the wind. We used that fragment in Wordsmiths for one of our more successful - and enlightening - writing exercises. All the blokes wrote about car chases and violent death. All the chicks wrote about tearful anxiety for a sister's hurt feelings. Genders may be equal, but we are definitely not the same!\n\nThe book page was traced to a Mills & Boon bodice ripper. Since we're distorting the content to our own preferences, I'm calling it the Bills & Moon exercise, echoing a slip I once made to your delight.\n\nTwo weeks ago another wind brought another single page of burnt book to my path. Let's have another go, shall we? Start with the fragment above and write us what happens next to Mary after she is discovered on the dyke at night.\n\nOnce again you will need to RSVP to this invite to see the Zoom link and password.

        "description": "Part I of the Bills & Moon Burnt Book Exerise took me by surprise yesterday evening. Guy called to ask me why the Zoom meeting wasn't started. It was because I thought it was next Tuesday, in our usual slot, but had made an error in the configuration of the Meetup invite, leaving the date unedited for Thursday evening.\n\nBecause we had assumed it was next week, neither Mike nor I had written to the exercise. Details on the exercise in the previous Meetup invitation: https://www.meetup.com/Shepperton-Wordsmiths-Meetup/events/271053792/\n\nAh well, it worked out just fine. There were 5 Wordsmiths on the Zoom meeting: Guy, David, Mike, Mandy and me. Guy, David and Mandy had written to the Bills & Moon exercise and each was chillingly wonderful. David's take on the events after Mary was captured on the dyke at night had her gain a bloody but satisfying revenge on her tormentor. Guy's adaptation had Mary flee into the night, pursued in her terror by a vengeful squire, and only saved by spirits of other maidens despoiled by evil squires who rose from the bog to save her. Mandy led us one way and then surprised us at the end. Her Mary had no escape, succumbing to blows, murdered by her captor, but had satisfaction at last in having secured some treasure to her aunt, who had quite accurately predicted how Mary would meet her death.\n\nAlthough all 3 writers chose to write thrillers starting with our bit of burnt scrip, they were each very different in tone and events. What fun!\n\nNext followed a discourse on D'Oyly Carte Island, which was vandalised over the weekend. I agreed to try to find some interior pictures to share. While doing that I got nosy and looked up the ownership on Companies House, writing to the owners about the vandalism and grafitti, and our worries about arson risk. The message has been passed on and hopefully some action will be taken to restore security on the site.\n\nFollowing on, Guy read us again his Writers' Club flash fiction, which was just as wonderful second time around.\n\nSo next week will be more of the Bills & Moon exercises from those of us who were unprepared this week. And with such time as Zoom permits, I'll be prepared to share some pictures of Eyot House on D'Oyly Carte Island. It's such a romantic ruin, we might have a future exercise set in its interior. . .",

It's been on my list, but I find things come off the list slower and slower these days.\n\nWe had a small but fun Wordsmiths on Zoom on 9th June. I completed the Bills & Moon fragment with proper bodice-ripper attraction, temptation, and seduction - but made Mary the aggressor in 'warming' up to the lonely farmer who gave her shelter from the moor. As Rosina commented afterward: \"Steamy, provocative, tut tut! Will they or won't they . . .\"\n\nDavid gave us one of his twist-in-the-tale endings, leading us to expect a wronged husband pursuing his wife with murderous intent, only to have her protector kill her lover on the moor instead.\n\nGuy gave us an evolution of economics from the Stone Age through the ages to modern economies, necessarily eliding over some of the small stuff like successive empires and religions.\n\nRosina hadn't written anything, but after came up with her preferred exercise for our next meeting: What made you laugh this week, or what caught your attention on a walk and why?\n\nI used the picture above because I remember in 1990 when I first encountered a \"Dogs Must Be Carried\" sign on the Underground at the escalators, I thought to myself, \"I don't have a dog. Do I need to take the stairs?\" I smile still whenever I see this sign.\n\nWe have decided to meet every two weeks, as we used to in the real world before Covid-19.\n\nBy the way, the Zoom link I send out for meetings is the same every time. So once you have it, copy it somewhere handy, like two weeks forward in your diary, and you'll always be able to reuse it.",

For the time being at least. Hopefully you’re all now comfortable with Zoom and so we’ll be meeting there.\nAt Rosina’s suggestion we would like you to select an item that is quirky, fun, or has a special place in your heart or home and request that you have it ready for a “Show and Tell” to the rest of us. Or alternatively, as usual you’d be welcome to entertain us with a reading. But please bear in mind that we have only 40 minutes or so in total and we’d like everyone to have the opportunity of a slot.\nLooking forward to seeing you there!\nDavid",

I've spoken to Brandon, the manager, and he is delighted we want to return. There is a limit currently on groups to a maximum of 8, so he has not been able to book the room out for events otherwise. We have not generally exceeded 8 recently, and never in Zoom meetings, so I'm confident we can keep within this bound for the near-term.\n\nBecause of the size restriction, I'd like everyone who plans to attend to RSVP using Meetup. If you have not registered as one of the first 8, you may not be able to attend. If we hit the limit, we can explore a Zoom connection for virtual participation.\n\nOf course, if you do register to attend, and then change your plans, please release your place via Meetup so that another Wordsmith can come along instead.\n\nTo celebrate our coming together at the Thames Court, let's make the first writing challenge a pub story. It can be based on real life or imagination, and a riverside pub setting is preferred. We might even share some stories with Brandon as a way of saying 'thanks'.",

        "description": "Wordsmiths reassembled upstairs at the Thames Court for the first time since Lock Down on 1st September. There were just four of us, but that let us space ourselves around a single large round table. It was great to catch up.\n\nGuy was congratulated for finishing 'Ironclaw', his novel about a Native American fighting pollution on ancestral lands. He then read us 'Blue', a poem to a lost love, a blue-eyed golden-skinned girl. The poem evokes the cadence of waves on the shore and was quite moving.\n\nDavid then gave us a gloomy visit to the 'Rose & Crown' on a Saturday afternoon after a long period abroad. All the regulars he counted as friends were discovered to have been imprisoned, fired, killed in accidents or debilitated by strokes, leaving him unable to share his stories or jokes over a pint. All except for Old Ben, the publican's dog inherited by the new owner. For once David's story has a happy ending. Instead of a twist in the tail there is a wagging tail.\n\nMandy gave us a charming and funny poem 'I name this pub' that runs through the possible names for a modern pub ('lukewarm pint and freezing loo') before deciding the name should fit the clientele: 'The Grumpy Goat'.\n\nI read a re-written opening to my narrowboat thriller that put Water Nomad and her skipper on a mooring in front of the Thames Court. After all, it's better to write what you know. Sharp-eared David caught me out in getting the river's direction of flow wrong in one passage, so further work needed.\n\nNext time we'll be up-skilling with advice from Erik Bork's 'The Idea: the seven elements of a viable story for screen, stage or fiction'. The topic will be punishing your characters with a very big, difficult and plot-sustaining problem or series of problems. As Erik says, \"Audiences are basically sadists.\" As an exercise think about the problem your main character faces in your stories and how the tension it creates carries the audience along with the story.\n\nAnd some readings from you, of course.\n\nI was going to write personally to some lapsed Wordsmiths we miss to try to get numbers up for next week, but as the maximum for these meetings has been reduced by Covid-19's surge from 8 to 6 persons, we'll hold off on that.\n\nAs before, please RSVP using Meetup to confirm your place.",

        "description": "Hey there, Wordsmiths! We were a tiny crowd of three for our most recent meeting, so David handed the admin back to me in despair. Cheer us both up with a Fairy Tale for our next and final meeting of 2020 on 15th December. You won't have the excuse of the office Christmas party this year for missing it!\n\nI thought we would write Fairy Tales for our exercise, inspired by the very beautiful leather-bound collection that Rosina gave me for my last birthday. The image above is the title page of the 1913 first edition of Clair de Lune and Other Troubadour Romances by Michael West, illustrated by Evelyn Paul, and music by Alfred Mereer.\n\nAs you would expect, the book came with a story. Rosina was given £20 by her mother-in-law for her 21st birthday to buy a new dress. Instead, she disappointed by buying three first edition books from an estate liquidation in a London used bookshop. The other two were later stolen, so this was the only one remaining.\n\nA week before she died Rosina gave me her final gift, a painting of the cherry tree in her garden with the table where we shared so many lovely tea parties, and Rosina herself in the Thames holding the side of her beloved rowboat and smiling, her blue eyes shining. You can see some of her paintings at her website: http://www.rosinalyford.com/. She was Royal Academy and exhibited all over the world.\n\nRosina passed away on 27th November, as gracefully as she lived, at home, in her own room fronting the Thames. Her granddaughter held her hand, and Ed sat by her as she slipped into the next life. Despite writing about ghosts in many of her stories, I saw her shortly afterward and don't think she left one. She was ready to cross over to wherever she is now.\n\nThis will be our last meeting for 2020, and it is a year I will be happy to see ending. Let's all look forward to 1st January 2021, when everybody will have 20/20 hindsight!",

It's probably too boring to be of general interest, but it's still something to celebrate.\n\nBring something of your writing to read, if you've been writing. It doesn't matter how little or how unfinished. We're always welcoming and supportive.\n\nAnyone new who wants to join will also be made very welcome.",

        "description": "We had our first in-person meeting of Wordsmiths in 2021 yesterday evening, upstairs at the Thames Court, as of old. There were only five of us, but the core Wordsmiths since our early days.\n\nMany of us found we had writers' block during the past year and a half of disrupted life. Apparently it is a recognised and quite common condition. Human interactions and a bit of randomness in life sustain the creative spirit.\nhttps://ethos3.com/2021/04/pandemic-writers-block-is-real/\n\nKaren, David and I offered readings. Karen read the prologue of her memoir, introducing herself from birth as a changeling forced to share a human life. David gave us a humorous and all too accurate story of the frustration getting any kind of appointment with a local GP under pandemic-revised restrictive rules of engagement. I read the first chapter of my end-of-life rom-com documenting the loss of Rosina, one of the founder Wordsmiths and a dear friend and neighbour. It was deemed hilarious, something Rosina would approve, though sadly I am the butt of every joke.\n\nMandy updated us on the progress of the adventurous dog Phoebe toward publication. Mike may take up his guide to the statues in central London, or such as are left after the 'woke' cull.\n\nSo now that we are all double-jabbed and can meet together and write again, it's time to make Wordsmiths even more fun and inspirational. We agreed to have a Wordsmiths Afloat day on the Thames, venturing to a more distant pub on my lovely broads cruiser Diona.\n\nI'll pick everyone up at Shepperton Lock for a cruise downriver to the Weir Hotel at Sunbury (where I found poor Mr Sturgess floating peacefully just downstream in February 2020). We'll enjoy their delicious food and drink, and then cruise back at a leisurely pace that will offer everyone on board a chance to take the wheel.\n\nBecause this event is kind of special, and space onboard is limited to 10 passengers, we agreed to limit participation to Wordsmiths who have actually attended an in-person meeting at some point prior. Please don't feel excluded if you don't make the cut, and join us instead at the usual Thames Court Wordsmiths on 21 September 2021 - the following Tuesday - 19:30.",

        "description": "We were intrigued by the five empty frames adorning the grey wall above us at the Thames Court upstairs room yesterday evening.\n\nWe discussed how these empty frames might be filled, not just with art, but with stories, with poetry, with haiku. (David learned anew of the ancient word art: https://www.britannica.com/art/haiku)\n\nSo our exercise for the next meeting at the Thames Court - not the jolly boat ride the week before - is to write something to fill an empty frame. Even with writers' block we should all be able to manage the 17 syllables (arranged in three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively) of a haiku, if not something more substantial.\n\nMike, who sent the photo above, is clearly up for the challenge. The accompanying email read:\n\nEmpty frames watch us\nGather to test our secret\nScrawled imaginings\n\nNote that we are reverting to the later meeting time of 19:30 which was customary for our meetings before lockdown. And also please bring £3 toward the costs of MeetUp and room rate.",
