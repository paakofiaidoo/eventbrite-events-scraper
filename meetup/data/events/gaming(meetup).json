Along the way, there will be a number of pit-stops, where we will rotate the groups and play more social games.</p> <p>After a few hours of nature, getting to know each other and working up a thirst, we'll head to a local pub and have a couple of drinks.</p> <p>**WHERE/WHEN WE WILL MEET**</p> <p>Meet Point - Opposite Köy Grill, 10 Royal Parade, Blackheath, London SE3 0TL (Location: [<a href=\"https://g.page/KoyGrillBlackheath?share](https://g.page/KoyGrillBlackheath?share\" class=\"linkified\">https://g.page/KoyGrillBlackheath?share](https://g.page/KoyGrillBlackheath?share</a>))</p> <p>Closest stations: Blackheath (5 mins walk)</p> <p>Destination: The Pilot, Greenwich</p> <p>Meet Time - 2:00pm (We will be leaving at 2:10pm, so don't be late!)</p> <p>Finish time: 5:00pm</p> <p>Pub Finish time: 7:00pm-8:30pm (Approx)</p> <p>**WHAT TO BRING**</p> <p>* Hiking shoes, boots or other suitable footwear<br/>* Good Waterproof jacket and trousers (in case it rains!)<br/>* Warm/Windproof layer (as it's London)<br/>* Camera &amp; phone<br/>* Snacks<br/>* Face mask, Hand Sanitizer etc.</p> <p>**HEALTH AND SAFETY**</p> <p>I'm sure you guys all know the drill by now, but just a reminder that everyone is responsible for their own safety on the walk and at the pub!<br/>Finally, the pub element is optional and so if you’d prefer not to head off following the walk, then no worries at all!</p> ",

From there, we will venture up the River Wandle, through Earlsfield and King George’s Park.</p> <p>The walk will then finish up at the Ram pub in Wandsworth where you can grab a drink, play some games and get to know your fellow hikers a bit better.</p> <p>Rather sadly, this old pub will actually be closing its doors for the final time the very next day following our visit.</p> <p>But to go out with a bang, the pub has kindly offered to provide free nachos, as well as opening up their popular taco van for those who would like to eat.</p> <p>You will also be able to play a game or two of floor Shuffleboard in their upstairs games area.</p> <p>**As with all our social walks, the afternoon will feature:**</p> <p>* A Range of Fun, Games and Entertainment<br/>* Speed Friending Activities<br/>* Expert Games Host and Walk Guide<br/>* Plenty of Like-Minded 20s to 30s<br/>* The Great Outdoors and Stunning Scenery<br/>* A Trip to the Pub (Optional but highly recommended!)</p> <p>Unfortunately owing to the size of the venue, we will be having to cap numbers for this event.</p> <p>And so do make sure you nab your place as soon as you can - as we will be having to turn off RSVPS when we’re nearing the capacity limit.</p> <p>**HOW IT WORKS**</p> <p>We will be meeting in Morden Hall Park (by the bridge) at 2:00pm.</p> <p>To start the event, you will be allocated a group/team for an initial mix of fun ice breaker games designed to get people talking and help you to get to know some of the other participants on the walk a little better.</p> <p>After the games, we will commence our 2-3 hour walk around the Heath. Along the way, there will be a number of pit-stops (approx every 30-40 mins) where we will rotate the groups and play more social games.</p> <p>After a few hours of nature, getting to know each other and working up a thirst, we'll head to a local pub and have a couple of drinks.</p> <p>**WHERE/WHEN WE WILL MEET**</p> <p>Meet Point - Morden Hall Park Bridge, Morden SM4 5JA (see location: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/fU9NX97j59oBdvNn6\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/fU9NX97j59oBdvNn6</a>)</p> <p>Closest stations: Morden (5-10 min walk)</p> <p>Destination: The Ram, Wandsworth</p> <p>Meet Time - 2:00pm (We will be leaving at 2:10pm, so don't be late!)</p> <p>Finish time: 5:00pm</p> <p>Pub Finish time: 7:00pm-8:30pm (Approx)</p> <p>**WHAT TO BRING**</p> <p>* Hiking shoes, boots or other suitable footwear<br/>* Good Waterproof jacket and trousers (in case it rains!)<br/>* Warm/Windproof layer (as it's London)<br/>* Camera &amp; phone<br/>* Snacks<br/>* Face mask, Hand Sanitizer etc.</p> <p>**HEALTH AND SAFETY**</p> <p>I'm sure you guys all know the drill by now, but just a reminder that everyone is responsible for their own safety on the walk and at the pub!</p> <p>Finally, the pub element is optional and so if you’d prefer not to head off following the walk, then no worries at all!</p> ",

Going forward, we will schedule in-person sessions at Seven Dials on Mondays, and continue our Online sessions on Tuesdays, where DM &amp; player interest is there!</p> <p>From first timers to veterans, drop in to any sessions you want. We'll sort you into groups in the text below approx 24 hours before the session starts, and get you started on a one-shot adventure that fits into our campaign setting.</p> <p>What is it?<br/>Casual drop-in games set in the same world with an over-arching story. Play as much and whenever you like! Never played? No problem! Arrive early and we'll help you build a character, or we have a few set ones you can borrow.</p> <p>What Do I Bring?<br/>Pencil &amp; paper, character sheet, dice, Player's Handbook &amp; any other source books your character uses.</p> <p>NEW PLAYERS:<br/>You can make a level 2 character (PHB+1) and jump right in. Let your DM know you're new. If you need help with creating a character, reach out to any DM or Admin in our Whatsapp chat or Discord ( <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR</a> ), we're happy to help you along!</p> <p>MORE INFO:<br/><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB</a></p> <p>Arrival: 6:30 - 7pm.<br/>Adventure!: 7-10pm<br/>After session social: 10-11pm.<br/>Please do be a few minutes early, as we MUST start at 7pm sharp!</p> <p>NB: The London Wargaming Guild is a non-profit, and is entirely volunteer-run. All fees charged go towards the running costs of the Guild (mostly venue rents) - every penny!</p> <p>Thus, organisers and DMs do not get paid for their time. We do it because we enjoy it, and because we love the community in the Guild - and we hope you will too!</p> ",

Going forward, we will schedule in-person sessions at Seven Dials on Mondays, and continue our Online sessions on Tuesdays, where DM &amp; player interest is there!</p> <p>From first timers to veterans, drop in to any sessions you want. We'll sort you into groups in the text below approx 24 hours before the session starts, and get you started on a one-shot adventure that fits into our campaign setting.</p> <p>What is it?<br/>Casual drop-in games set in the same world with an over-arching story. Play as much and whenever you like! Never played? No problem! Arrive early and we'll help you build a character, or we have a few set ones you can borrow.</p> <p>What Do I Bring?<br/>Pencil &amp; paper, character sheet, dice, Player's Handbook &amp; any other source books your character uses.</p> <p>NEW PLAYERS:<br/>You can make a level 2 character (PHB+1) and jump right in. Let your DM know you're new. If you need help with creating a character, reach out to any DM or Admin in our Whatsapp chat or Discord ( <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR</a> ), we're happy to help you along!</p> <p>MORE INFO:<br/><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB</a></p> <p>Arrival: 6:30 - 7pm.<br/>Adventure!: 7-10pm<br/>After session social: 10-11pm.<br/>Please do be a few minutes early, as we MUST start at 7pm sharp!</p> <p>NB: The London Wargaming Guild is a non-profit, and is entirely volunteer-run. All fees charged go towards the running costs of the Guild (mostly venue rents) - every penny!</p> <p>Thus, organisers and DMs do not get paid for their time. We do it because we enjoy it, and because we love the community in the Guild - and we hope you will too!</p> ",

Going forward, we will schedule in-person sessions at Seven Dials on Mondays, and continue our Online sessions on Tuesdays, where DM &amp; player interest is there!</p> <p>From first timers to veterans, drop in to any sessions you want. We'll sort you into groups in the text below approx 24 hours before the session starts, and get you started on a one-shot adventure that fits into our campaign setting.</p> <p>What is it?<br/>Casual drop-in games set in the same world with an over-arching story. Play as much and whenever you like! Never played? No problem! Arrive early and we'll help you build a character, or we have a few set ones you can borrow.</p> <p>What Do I Bring?<br/>Pencil &amp; paper, character sheet, dice, Player's Handbook &amp; any other source books your character uses.</p> <p>NEW PLAYERS:<br/>You can make a level 2 character (PHB+1) and jump right in. Let your DM know you're new. If you need help with creating a character, reach out to any DM or Admin in our Whatsapp chat or Discord ( <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR</a> ), we're happy to help you along!</p> <p>MORE INFO:<br/><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB</a></p> <p>Arrival: 6:30 - 7pm.<br/>Adventure!: 7-10pm<br/>After session social: 10-11pm.<br/>Please do be a few minutes early, as we MUST start at 7pm sharp!</p> <p>NB: The London Wargaming Guild is a non-profit, and is entirely volunteer-run. All fees charged go towards the running costs of the Guild (mostly venue rents) - every penny!</p> <p>Thus, organisers and DMs do not get paid for their time. We do it because we enjoy it, and because we love the community in the Guild - and we hope you will too!</p> ",

This meetup is for an ONLINE session!</p> <p>From first timers to veterans, drop in to any sessions you want. We'll sort you into groups in the text below approx 24 hours before the session starts, and get you started on a one-shot adventure that fits into our campaign setting. We do most of our organising in our WhatsApp, including sharing links to join games. Keep an eye on the Whatsapp in the hour before your game starts!</p> <p>We don't share WhatsApp links publicly. If you're not in the WhatsApp, ask for an invite on our Discord <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR</a></p> <p>Our DMs all run games differently, so please be prepared to be flexible. Most use Roll20 and Discord, but some might use other platforms like VTT and Googlemeets. Our DMs also all run different styles of game - Theatre of the Mind vs Battlemaps, Heavy Roleplay vs Heavy Combat, etc - please be prepared to roll with that too!</p> <p>If possible, please have to hand: A headset with mic (Echoes are mood-killers!) A webcam (It's a social game, and it helps if we can see each other!) A shareable character sheet Dice for physical rolling (some DMs are very trusting!)</p> <p>NEW PLAYERS: What is it? Casual drop-in games set in the same world with an over-arching story. Play as much and whenever you like! Never played? No problem! You can make a level 2 character (PHB+1) and jump right in. If you reach out to any DM or in our Whatsapp chat, we're happy to help you along!

All fees charged go towards the running costs of the Guild (mostly venue rents) - every penny!</p> <p>Thus, organisers and DMs do not get paid for their time.

        "description": "<p>Welcome to the LWG Casual D&amp;D Campaign! We are currently running in-person sessions in Central London on Mondays, and online sessions on Tuesdays! This meetup is for an ONLINE session!</p> <p>From first timers to veterans, drop in to any sessions you want. We'll sort you into groups in the text below approx 24 hours before the session starts, and get you started on a one-shot adventure that fits into our campaign setting. We do most of our organising in our WhatsApp, including sharing links to join games. Keep an eye on the Whatsapp in the hour before your game starts!</p> <p>We don't share WhatsApp links publicly. If you're not in the WhatsApp, ask for an invite on our Discord <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR</a></p> <p>Our DMs all run games differently, so please be prepared to be flexible. Most use Roll20 and Discord, but some might use other platforms like VTT and Googlemeets. Our DMs also all run different styles of game - Theatre of the Mind vs Battlemaps, Heavy Roleplay vs Heavy Combat, etc - please be prepared to roll with that too!</p> <p>If possible, please have to hand: A headset with mic (Echoes are mood-killers!) A webcam (It's a social game, and it helps if we can see each other!) A shareable character sheet Dice for physical rolling (some DMs are very trusting!)</p> <p>NEW PLAYERS: What is it?

Going forward, we will schedule in-person sessions at Seven Dials on Mondays, and continue our Online sessions on Tuesdays, where DM &amp; player interest is there!</p> <p>From first timers to veterans, drop in to any sessions you want. We'll sort you into groups in the text below approx 24 hours before the session starts, and get you started on a one-shot adventure that fits into our campaign setting.</p> <p>What is it?<br/>Casual drop-in games set in the same world with an over-arching story. Play as much and whenever you like! Never played? No problem! Arrive early and we'll help you build a character, or we have a few set ones you can borrow.</p> <p>What Do I Bring?<br/>Pencil &amp; paper, character sheet, dice, Player's Handbook &amp; any other source books your character uses.</p> <p>NEW PLAYERS:<br/>You can make a level 2 character (PHB+1) and jump right in. Let your DM know you're new. If you need help with creating a character, reach out to any DM or Admin in our Whatsapp chat or Discord ( <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR</a> ), we're happy to help you along!</p> <p>MORE INFO:<br/><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB</a></p> <p>Arrival: 6:30 - 7pm.<br/>Adventure!: 7-10pm<br/>After session social: 10-11pm.<br/>Please do be a few minutes early, as we MUST start at 7pm sharp!</p> <p>NB: The London Wargaming Guild is a non-profit, and is entirely volunteer-run. All fees charged go towards the running costs of the Guild (mostly venue rents) - every penny!</p> <p>Thus, organisers and DMs do not get paid for their time. We do it because we enjoy it, and because we love the community in the Guild - and we hope you will too!</p> ",

Going forward, we will schedule in-person sessions at Seven Dials on Mondays, and continue our Online sessions on Tuesdays, where DM &amp; player interest is there!</p> <p>From first timers to veterans, drop in to any sessions you want. We'll sort you into groups in the text below approx 24 hours before the session starts, and get you started on a one-shot adventure that fits into our campaign setting.</p> <p>What is it?<br/>Casual drop-in games set in the same world with an over-arching story. Play as much and whenever you like! Never played? No problem! Arrive early and we'll help you build a character, or we have a few set ones you can borrow.</p> <p>What Do I Bring?<br/>Pencil &amp; paper, character sheet, dice, Player's Handbook &amp; any other source books your character uses.</p> <p>NEW PLAYERS:<br/>You can make a level 2 character (PHB+1) and jump right in. Let your DM know you're new. If you need help with creating a character, reach out to any DM or Admin in our Whatsapp chat or Discord ( <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/Dg2BeDR</a> ), we're happy to help you along!</p> <p>MORE INFO:<br/><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1s22yxbraAcz53UcUE1iM8WhMeTIcRQWB</a></p> <p>Arrival: 6:30 - 7pm.<br/>Adventure!: 7-10pm<br/>After session social: 10-11pm.<br/>Please do be a few minutes early, as we MUST start at 7pm sharp!</p> <p>NB: The London Wargaming Guild is a non-profit, and is entirely volunteer-run.
