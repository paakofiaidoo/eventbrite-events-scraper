So if you are wondering whether to come or not.....go for it, what ever happens it will be fun and you will get to meet some great people!\n\nI hope to have a guest dating coach to attend as well to give us their point of view on the subject.......details will be confirmed nearer the time.\n\nThe Meet Up starts at 7pm, the coaching session will take place 7.30-8.30, leaving us half an hour to network before we finish at 9pm.

The long weekend of jazz in Brussels coincides with the second Bank holiday in May so you would need to take only Friday off.

        "description": "Connect with your eyes!\n\nWhat are Eye Gazing Parties? The eyes are the windows to the soul, so it’s a lot easier to have a mesmerizing conversation with someone after you’ve spent two minutes looking into his or her eyes. That is the simple idea behind Eye Gazing Parties. Banal chit-chat about employment status, the location of your apartment, or where you’re from is not a great way to spark a captivating connection with an alluring new person. Eye contact is.\n\nHere’s how it works. An even number of singles gets together in an attractive space. After a fun mini-lesson in the art of eye contact, the group splits into pairs, and each pair spends two minutes looking at each other’s eyes, no talking, with inviting beats in the background. The pairs switch up every two minutes, for a total of forty-five minutes. Then there’s a party afterward, with drinks flowing and luscious beats vibing. You can talk with everyone you met gazing to get to know each other even better and exchange information with potential dates. The eye gazing has an electrifying effect on the party. Simply put, two minutes of eye contact is the Cadillac of ice-breakers.\n\nEye Gazing Parties were invented by Michael Ellsberg and have been featured in the New York Times, CNN, Good Morning America, Match.com, Nerve.com, MSNBC, the BBC, and in Tim Ferriss’s #1 New York Times bestseller The Four-Hour Workweek (pp. 60-61). Elle magazine called Eye Gazing Parties “New York’s hottest dating trend.” They’ve happened across America and in Australia, Singapore, and Budapest!\n\nEntry:  £6 on the door\n\nOr book online for £5 at:\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Silent-Speed-Dating-Eye-Gazing-Parties/\n\nTo be kept up to date with any last minute changes it is best you register for this event at\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Silent-Speed-Dating-Eye-Gazing-Parties/",

Also I have people coming from my outdoors activity group here: https://www.meetup.com/londonsocialcruzers/\n\nYou don't need a telescope as you will be able to view through scopes belonging to me and other club members (as long as you behave responsibily and don't temper with equipment worth several thousands). If you have your own telescope feel free to bring it along also and I can help you with setting up if you're a newbie.\n\nIn between observing we'll have a drink and having engaging chats on all astronomy related topics for those inclined (astrobiology, SETI/Femi Paradox, astrophysics, cosmology etc.) as well as everyday non space topics and banter. No doubt we'll hear the usual jokes I've heard hundreds of times before!\n\nAlcoholic beverage (wine, beer, cider only), hot drinks and food/snacks will be available to purchase at the observation point/warm indoor cafe with seating area and outside (glass) view of the park.\nI will also have people coming from my outdoor adventures group plus some from Calvin's so total RSVPs are higher than what you see here for this reason!\n\n====ITINERARY=====\nMeet outside Camden Tube Station at 7.00 PM. After a short wait for anyone delayed, I will escort everyone to the observation point in Regent's Park and brief everyone in terms what to expect and instructions for interacting with any Telescopes. The walk will take 15-20 mins max. Around 10.45 or earlier if the weather turns sour, we will leave and I will walk the group back to Camden. Alternatively people can also take a bus or walk from the observation point to Baker Street. Sometimes a few of us go for a drink in Camden afterwards. I will send out my contact number to people who have reserved for the event in case you have of any issues finding us.\n===What Can You Expect To See (this time of year)? =====\n\n* Orion Nebula\n* Jupiter and 4 moons\n* Star clusters such as The Owl Cluster, pleiades etc\n* International Space station fly by\n* Saturn & rings\n* Venus & Mercury\n* Andromedia Galaxy\n* Binary & tripple star systems (think planet *Tatooine in* Starwars!),\n* Neptune\n* Uranuus\n* Mars\n* Our moon\n\nMore here from Jodrell Bank Observatory/Astrophysics Centre:\n[http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/)\nGuide to viewing the cosmos for beginners:\n[https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp)\n===Weather=====\nThe event is subject to clear skies on the night so if on the actual day of the event the weather conditions are confirmed unsuitable beyond doubt then I may cancel or postpone. As long as the event is still advertised here, it will be going ahead at designated time!\n\nThe event is free but if you would like to make a small contribution to help towards the costs of running of the amateur astronomy club (public liability insurance, fees to Regent's Park etc.) we will be joining then please let me know and I would direct you to the right people.\n\nHappy Stargazing!\n\nLucas Skywalker (Amateur Musical Astronomer)",

Optionally we'll discuss American politics, the constitution addressing questions like whether the American Constitution was designed to promote or Inhibit democracy.\n\nIf you can do an american accent that would be swell as well we absolutely love impersonations and fun people that can make us laugh when we chillout.\n\nLater in the eve at dusk there will be a special guest appearence from an American Warewolf in London who you'll get to meet...\n\nMeet outside Archway station. We will do a walk around Highgate Village 15 mins up the road first and then to the American bar from there. I am putting this event on very short notice and so we will only go ahead on Independence day if we have at least 15 RSVPs.\n\nLucas - Founding Father of Chillout (move aside George Washington!)",

Usually we have two highly experienced guitarists, a drummer and two backing vocalists. Note that song options are likely to be confined to mainstream soul/blues, pop, rock & RnB genres spanning mutiple music decades from contemporary to classics so there should be a song for everyone (as long as you don't steal one of mine!).\n\nThis is a join event with another group so the number of RSVPs will be higher than what you see here. So limiting RSVPs because the place will be very busy and there will be limited slots for songs. The venue will be: Radicals & Victuallers, 59 Upper St, London N1 0NY\n\nLucas The Entertainer",

        "description": "Monthly informal social & networking for us to get know each other over drinks, share some banter and opinions on state of markets & economies and how we should be positioned in terms of short to medium term trades/investments.\n\nObjective here will be to share our thoughts (it's always useful to hear contrarian views and most critically the why) our favourite/most successful indicators & strategies, knowledge acquisition and coming away with some potential trade/investment ideas. But let's not forget this will be a social so we'll have some much needed fun as well!\n\nIt will be run in conjunction with my investing strategies group so total RSVPs is higher than what you see here. You can register at following link so stay updated on relevent events and see other RSVPs: https://www.meetup.com/investing-trading-macroeconomics-financial-markets/\n\n**Some potential market impacting themes & latest hot global political & economic developments to ponder:**\n\n1. Central banks tightening and implications for global asset prices (stocks, currencies, crypto, commodities, bond yields, property) and outlook for inflation & economic growth.\n2. Current valuations, risk of market crash and prolonged bear market for the major indices. The biggest \"everything bubble\" since 2000 finally began to unwind Q4 2021 with Nasdax down -30% & some tech stocks down -90%. How more low could we go? A lot lower than people think.\n3. My proprietary indicators are forecating a global slowdown in earnings so I see fair value for stocks at much lower mutiples (PE) fulled partly by higher business costs whilst ponzinomics cryptos intrinsic value worth close to zero though - given high volatility - ok for short term trade but watch out below. Japan is now even more fucked with their failed 30 year QE experiment delivering a 50 year low valueless Yen. Is a FX mean reversion trade worth a punt? With the Euro near dollar parity is the failed EU project likely to follow suit soon?\n4. Geo political events including but not limited to Russian invasion, financial sanctions and spillovers to global markets and economies.\n5. As a US presidential candidate on the campaign trail once mocked the incumbent: \"it's the economy - stupid\". My leading indicators predicting major contraction if not outright global recession. Apart from the Bank of England, are the ECB/Fed in denial? The 3000+ Phd economists can't all be useless or maybe it's just Jay? Never get a lawyer whose decisions negatively effect billions globally to do a real man's job (what was congress/ president thinking appointing him and for that matter Yellen & Bernanke who have never worked in the real world either).\n6. Market Sentiment & Earnings. Spurred by recency bias, it seems many who never invested in a pre GFC regime have been buying the dips. Beware of the high correlation between growth slowdown & lower company earnings / misses (minus share buybacks). Yes sentiment/investor pyschology can matter short term but profitability ultimately drive prices, even extreme oversold signals on technicals can lose predictive value depending on market regime & levels of risk aversion.\n7. Depth of policy tightening & credibility reassertion. Economists pricing in rates to 3.5% along with QT. If inflation persists will a deep global recession be the price we have to pay? Many expect Fed pivot but with inflation forecasts nowhere near target & unemployment well below level considered consisitent with price stability (NAIRU), why would they? This is not 2012 nor 2018 - the only thing that has pivoted is the economic paradigm with nearest parallels - UK/US/Europe in 70s/80s. Asset price mandate doesn't exist, the best empirical evidence shows long term growth suffers and the poor get even poorer. Don't Fight the Fed\n8. UK interest rate rises / monetary policy tightening and implications for house prices & economy. Looks like we're heading into recession soon (or already in one). BOE's governer blaming everything from Ukraine to sunspot activity at the annoyance of the MPC hawks! If Liz Truss becomes new PM we could see a shift in the economic strategy forcing even higher rates crushing house prices\n9. Risks from new Covid variants and macro impact. What's going on with China lockdown of cities like Shanghai? Something not right - ulterior motives to cripple global economy & further add to supply constraints to aid Putin's war? Who knows - as Philosopher Socrates once graciously said \"I know nothin\".

The only differentiated coffee event with mind numbing boring small talk left at home & with Chillout's resident Guru Swami offering free insightful thought provoking readings - just for a bit of fun of course!\n\nIf you're intellectually curious, open minded and inquisitive about life's big questions and potential links to noetic sciences & consciousness then is defo for you. We'll try to touch on the empirical literature/evidence for paranormal phenomena & potential explanations including ( I can share research studies with you) :\n\n\\- Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?\n\n\\- Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" \\(quantum entanglement\\) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?\n\n\\- What existed before the universe \\(big bang\\) \\- how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play and suggest about unknown dimensions and out understanding of entwined space and time?\n\n\"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking once said. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?\n\n\\- Is the near death experieince phenomena millions have experienced a result of neurochemical and hormonal changes that occur in the body & brain close to death \\(esp\\. in truma conditions\\) or something beyond physicality?\n\n\\- Given neuroscience research is in it's infancy relative to other areas of medicine/science and so there is yet still so little understanding of the brain\\, could mediation help to access additional functions that are not available when we are operate in BAU alpha\\, beta and gamma brainwaves phases?\n\n\\- As well as the brain \\- studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons\\. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in Last Christmas?\n\nThe smartest philsoophers and scientists know we will never know the real truth but can we employ any experimental and other practical empirical techniques to get there? An approach guided by Immanuel Kant's pragamatism & Aristotle's deductive reasoning seems the most optimal epistemology here but is there any other methodologies?\n\n=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================\nWe'll meet inside The Zodiac Bar in Camden. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group. I'll be wearing a Starwars identifier and also share table location on the day.\n\nThe event is subject to securing at least 10 confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend. In the case of a waiting list - priority will be given to people than can demonstrate a genuine interest in the broader subject area, acquaintances and most loyal members.\n\nRemember our jingo - great stimulating but fun interesting meetups for a great city for free with Chillout London.\n\nGuru Swami Lucas",

        "description": "Ever looked up at those twinkles in the night sky and wondered what it's all about - the universe, what's out there, why are we here, where in the cosmos other civilizations might live nearby?\n\nThen RSVP to view the breathtaking rings of Saturn, the expected life harboring moons of Jupiter, the space station fly-by, the Tau Ceti star/system with 2 Earth like planets in the habitable zone that might be harboring advanced life and a range of other fascinating celestial wonderments (star systems, galaxies, asteroids, meteors) over drinks and conversation this July.\n\nI'm able to take a strictly limited number of people (please only RSVP if you can defo make it) to join a friendly informal relaxed local astronomers group I have been a member for over 10 years & their regulars made up of to about 100 people. You don't need a telescope as you will be able to view through scopes belonging to me and other club members (as long as you behave responsibily and don't temper with expensive equipment ). If you have your own telescope feel free to bring it along also and I can help you with setting up if you're a newbie.\n\nIn between observing we'll have having engaging chats over a wine/coffee on all astronomy related spheres for those inclined (e.g.astrobiology, SETI, femi paradox, astrophysics, cosmology etc.) as well as some non cosmos non space topics and banter for variety. No doubt we'll listen to the usual space jokes I've heard hundreds of times before!\n\nAlcoholic beverage (wine, beer, cider), hot drinks and food/snacks will be available to purchase at the observation point/indoor cafe with seating area and outside (glass) view of the park.\nI will also have people coming from other groups so total RSVPs will be higher than what you see here!\n\n====ITINERARY=====\nMeet outside Camden Tube Station at 7.00 PM. After a short wait for anyone delayed, I will escort everyone to the observation point in Regent's Park and brief everyone in terms what to expect and instructions for interacting with any Telescopes and their owners. The walk will take 15-20 mins max. Around 10.45 or earlier if the weather turns sour, we will leave and I will walk the group back to Camden. Alternatively people can also take a bus or walk from the observation point to Baker Street. Sometimes a few of us go for a drink in Camden afterwards. I will send out my contact number to people who have reserved for the event in case you have of any issues finding us.\n\n===What Can You Expect To See (this time of year)? =====\n\n* Orion Nebula\n* Jupiter and 4 moons\n* Star clusters such as The Owl Cluster, pleiades etc\n* International Space station fly by\n* Saturn & rings\n* Venus & Mercury\n* Andromedia Galaxy\n* Binary & tripple star systems (think planet *Tatooine in* Starwars!),\n* Neptune\n* Uranuus\n* Mars\n* Our moon\n\nMore here from Jodrell Bank Observatory/Astrophysics Centre:\n[http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/)\nGuide to viewing the cosmos for beginners:\n[https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp)\n\n===Weather=====\nThe event is subject to clear skies on the night so if on the actual day of the event the weather conditions are confirmed unsuitable beyond doubt then I may postpone or in some cases we may meet anyway for some cosmology chat. But ss long as the event is still advertised here, it will be going ahead at designated time!\n\nThe event is free but if you would like to make a small contribution to help towards the costs of running of the amateur astronomy club (public liability insurance, fees to Regent's Park etc.) we will be joining then please let me know and I would direct you to the right people.\n\nHappy Stargazing!\n\nLucas Skywalker (Amateur Astronomer)",

And if you want to know what a particular song lyrics was about/meaning - just ask. if I know I will tell you!\n\nThe tour will end in Paul's local pub where we'll have a drink and maybe we'll all have a mini sing along though last time I did that we got thrown out being told firmly by the governer that it wasn't a Karoake pub! Haha\n\nIn between stops at key monuments, we will walk at a medium to fast pace. It is advisible to wear/bring trainers.\n\nI also have people coming from one of my other group's (https://www.meetup.com/LondonSocialCruzers/events/285390062/) hence total RSVPs here are higher than the raw face counts you just see.\n\nLucas The Fool on the Hill",

If you've ever attended those you'll know it's all a load of bollox mostly full of indiscriminate desperados that will get off with ANY one, NOT seeking to MEET the ONE!\n\nYes generic social meetups can be a horrible soul destroying places devoid of attractive and successful high quaility people with depth & genuine romantic intentions (often disguised as sex). That why we are teaming up with Socialite Connections & sister groups to put on an anti-valentines neutral free event. This will not only discourage people turning up to explore coping off opportunities especially with vulnerable women feeling the pressure of superficial days like this. Tonight will just be a social but freindly event all centered around having fun highly engaging conversations and laughs over a drink or two.\n\nSo if you think this day is a fake - and you're also looking for your 1 in 500,000 person rather than just someone and are not deluded enougth to think you'll meet them at a singles group or during the week of Feb 14 then tonight will be for you!! We recognise it's a workday after probably a heavy alcohol infused weekend so we're not proposing a party - just something light to fill your evening in case you don't want to be on your own or you just wanna get away from your partner for the night (we completely understand!)\n\n=====Venue & Plan====\nOn arrival, tell door security that the reservation is booked under Socialite Connections / Michelle & Lucas. You will be directed to the VIP area. Free pizza will served at 9pm for everyone to share.\n\nThis is a JOIN EVENT run in conjunction with other groups (led by Michelle) so the number of collective RSVPs/attendees is much higher then what you see on the list. This event will be fully hosted with very fun, outgoing & entertaining socially skilled organisers - including myself - on site until the very end to introduce you and ignite stimulating conversations with other like minded people.\n\nLucas The Hate Doctor",

Please RSVP to the lunch separately, as it is listed as a separate event and spaces are limited.\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Ceramics Café – Farnham is a bright creative studio space that has been established for over 10 years.\n\nWe are living in a world where individual expression is encouraged, but mass consumerism dictates what we buy, where we go and how we spend our leisure time. The Ceramics Café offers you the opportunity to create something that is uniquely yours. Starting with a plain white blank (bisque) shape, you paint on your design using ceramic paints (underglazes), they fire it for you in the kiln, and your piece is ready for collection within 2-4 days.\n\nCosts:\n-£2.00 per decorator plus the In-Studio cost of the items painted.\n-Typical In-Studio costs range from £8.00 to £20.00 per item depending on what you choose to paint.\n\nThe £2.00 session fee covers the use of the studio for up to two hours. The In-Studio cost covers the bisque (blank) item being painted, use of the OPUS underglaze colours, glazing and firing your finished masterpiece(s).\n\nFinished items are ideal to keep for use at home or giving away as gifts. Christmas is one of their busiest times where the majority of items painted are given away to family and friends. All finished items are suitable for use with food.\n\nTo keep our numbers in check for this reserved seating event, please make sure your RSVP is kept updated so that all those who'd like to attend have the opportunity to do so.\n\nLook forward to seeing you soon! 👩🏻‍🎨👩🏾‍🎨👩🏼‍🎨",

We will then take a private train ride under The Thames in the first ever tunnel built below a river, it's over 160 years old. What a photo opportunity!!\n\nAfter exploring the tunnel, we will return to The Mayflower for a slap up pub meal. Obviously you don't have to stay for this but it would be good to chat about what we've just experienced.\n\nFind the location on https://www.streetmap....

Black swans glide on the moat and waterways, peacocks wander through the grounds and birds of prey soar on the wind during daily falconry displays.\n\nThe gardens offer continuous colour throughout the year. From a mass of spring bulbs and wild flowers in the wood garden, through fragrant herbs and roses in the quintessentially English Culpeper garden, to late flowering borders in the drought-resistant Mediterranean garden.\n\nAlso on the day we go, in the afternoon their is a medieval jousting tournament.\n\nEntry to the castle is £15, although if their is more than 15 of us, we can get in for £11 each.\n\nTo get there, the aim is to get the 10:18am train from London Victoria station, which according to www.thetrainline.com, costs £15.10 which is a cheap day return to Bearsted (nearest station to the castle).\nIf you wish to book this online in advance please do so, as it might be slightly more if you buy your train ticket on the day.\nOnce we get to Bearsted, their is a shuttle coach service to the castle which is £5 return.\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nRegards\n\nRobert\n07905 901 834",

The nearest station is Waterloo.\n\nDetails of the pub below:\nhttps://www.beerinthee... (https://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/21/213/Wellington/Waterloo)\n\nDetails of the play:\nWhen writing the pilot episode for a new TV cop show Alan has to confront a dilemma: should he kill off the character he has turned into a model police officer, a responsible and caring mother with a partner and two children while allowing her alcoholic superior officer to live? Or should he kill off someone merely because of being an alcoholic with no close family? But they're fictional aren't they, he isn't really going to kill anyone is he? Alan's philosophical and academic dilemma suddenly takes on a very real dimension and he becomes unable to separate the fiction from the real world. But things may not be quite what they seem...\n\nIf you wish to see the play, you will need to book beforehand as their may not be tickets available on the night.

His extensive building programme included the Pantheon in Rome, his villa in Tivoli and the city of Antinoopolis, which he founded and named after his male lover Antinous.\nThis unprecedented exhibition will provide fresh insight into the sharp contradictions of Hadrian?s character and challenges faced during his reign.\nObjects from 28 museums worldwide and finds from recent excavations will be shown together for the first time to reassess his legacy, which remains strikingly relevant today.\n\nEntry to the exhibition is £12.\n\nIf you can't see us at the station, give me a call.\n\nHope to see you there.\n\nRegards\n\nRobert\n07905 901 834",

(https://www.rceltickets.com/viewbasket.asp)\n\nDue to the amount of people who wish to visit the Palace, they need to allocate a time to enter, if you choose 1:30pm, we can all enter together. The visit will take about 2 hours.\n\nWhat there is to see\nThe State Rooms form the heart of the working palace and are lavishly furnished with some of the greatest treasures from the Royal Collection - paintings by Rembrandt, Rubens, Poussin and Canaletto; sculpture by Canova; exquisite examples of Sèvres porcelain; and some of the finest English and French furniture.\n\nFor 2008 only\nFor the first time ever, visitors will be able to experience the spectacle of the Palace’s Ballroom set up for a State Banquet. For centuries magnificent banquets have been an integral part of royal ceremonial and the traditional way to mark significant events. Among the most important of these occasions is the State Banquet, held in honour of a visiting Head of State. This is the occasion when Her Majesty and other members of the Royal Family entertain around 160 specially invited guests on the first evening of a State Visit. During the course of her reign The Queen has held 97 State Banquets.\n\nThe Garden\nDescribed as a 'walled oasis in the middle of London', the Palace's garden is home to thirty different species of bird and more than 350 different wild flowers, some extremely rare. Visitors end their tour with a walk along the south side of the garden, with splendid views of the west front of the Palace and the famous lake.\n\nIf you wish to come along, remember to book a ticket in advance. As always, we can pop into a local bar or cafe afterwards for a chat over a drink.\n\nHope to see you there.\n\nRegards\n\nRobert\n07905 901 834",

As its name says, the village sits on the River Avon. Its a very picturesque village situated around a medieval church with many thatched and half-timbered cottages from the Tudor and Medieval period.\n\n**Temple Grafton**\nThe village sits a few miles from Welford-upon-Avon. The name is misleading, as the village has no connections with the 'Knights Templar' of the 13th century and is a naming error from the reign of Henry VIII.\nThe village has its links to William Shakespeare, with a local story about him joining a drinking group visiting villages drinking in a pub in each village. He then apparently fell asleep under a tree in Temple Grafton.\nThe village also has lots of pretty medieval and Tudor houses.\n\n**Warwick**\nWarwick is the county town and is one of England's smallest county towns. Its a very pretty town, siting on the River Avon, with the oldest part situated near to Warwick Castle, which you can visit. Its been a settlement since pre Roman times and gets its name from Anglo Saxon times meaning 'settlement by a weir'.\n\nI'll be giving you a mini guided tour of all three, before leaving you to explore on your own.\n\n**Coach seating**\n\n* If you wish to reserve a seat on the coach in advance, after you pay please look at the seating plan in the photos and then email me ([general@cultureseekers.org](http://general@cultureseekers.org)) with the seat number/s you wish to reserve.

It was founded in 1762 and was owned by the German-originated Baring family of merchants and bankers.\n\nThe bank collapsed in 1995 after suffering losses of £827 million resulting from poor speculative investments, primarily in futures contracts, conducted by its employee Nick Leeson, working at its office in Singapore. The story was turned into a film called *'Rogue Trader'*, which came out in 1999.\n\nThe Dutch bank ING, purchased Barings Bank in 1995 for the nominal sum of £1. The purchase included Barings extensive art collection and historical documents going back to its formation in 1762.\n\nWe will have a 2 hour curator guided tour of the art that ING purchased from Barings. It is situated in the companies hallways and meeting rooms. We will also be able to see Barings archives going back to its formation.\n\n**Please note: there is a limit on how many people we can take on the tour, so if you can't make it, please remember to change your RSVP to no.**\n\n**Payment**\nTour cost is £5 donation per person (payable by cash on the day). The charge goes to ING's charities ([XLP](https://www.xlp.org.uk/) and [Tommys](https://www.tommys.org/)).\n\nThe bank offers free wine and nibbles when we arrive.\n\n**Afterwards**\nAfterwards we will head to 'The Counting House' pub, 50 Cornhill for a chat over a drink.\n\nIf you can, please come to the pub afterwards, as its a great way to meet others after the visit.\n\nPlease note, we only wait outside the station for 10 minutes after the advertised meeting time, so please be early or on time.\n\nIf you can't see us outside the station, please text.\n\nLook out for the red & blue 'London Cultureseekers' group sign.\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nRobert\n07905 901 834 (text only)\n\nPlease make sure you are aware of the group rules here before RSVPing - [https://www.meetup.com/London_Cultureseekers/pages/26449165/Group_Rules/](https://www.meetup.com/London_Cultureseekers/pages/26449165/Group_Rules/)",

        "description": "Come along on Saturday 13th August for a day trip to historic Colchester!\n\n**About Colchester**\nColchester is said to be the oldest recorded town in Britain on the grounds that it was mentioned by Roman historian Pliny the Elder who mentioned it in his work in AD 77. But before the Roman conquest of Britain it was already a centre of power for the Catuvellauni tribe.\n\nSoon after the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43, it served as a provincial Roman capital of Britain, but was attacked and destroyed during Boudica's rebellion in AD 61. The town walls were built in AD 65–80 to protect it against future attacks.\n\nIn the 11th century, the invading Norman's built Colchester Castle, which was built on top of the vaults of the old Roman temple to Claudius. A large part of the stone that was used to build the castle was taken from the abandoned Roman buildings in the town.\n\nWhen we arrive, we will be having a guided tour of the city and also visiting the Norman castle and its Roman vaults.\n\n**Aprox itinerary**\n10:02am - catch train\n11:04am - arrive at Colchester Station and walk to the castle\n11:30am - tour of the Roman vaults and then self-guiding around the castle\n1:00pm - lunch, there are lots of places to eat in Colchester or you can bring your own food\n2:00pm - guided tour of the town\n4:00pm - finish, freetime: head back to the station, go to a pub or coffee shop or walk around the city\n\n**Train tickets**\nGroupSave return tickets work out at £19.85 each (purchase on the day in groups of 3 when you turn up).\n\nTrains going back at: 4:12pm, 4:43pm and the same times past each hour.\n\n**Cost**\nEntry cost to the castle & tour of the Roman vaults is £14 per person, the guided tour of the city is £7 per person (payable by cash on the day). You can decide to do both of these or just one.\n\n**Food & Drink**\nIts up to you whether you bring your own food or drink for the day or eat in one of the pubs or cafes in Colchester.\n\nPlease note, we only wait at the station for 10 minutes after the advertised meeting time, so please be early or on time.\n\nIf you can't see us at the station, please text.\n\nLook out for the red & blue 'London Cultureseekers' group sign.\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nRobert\n07905 901 834 (prefer text)\n\nPlease make sure you are aware of the group rules here before RSVPing - [https://www.meetup.com/London_Cultureseekers/pages/26449165/Group_Rules/](https://www.meetup.com/London_Cultureseekers/pages/26449165/Group_Rules/)",

It replaced Hatfield Palace, built in 1497.\n\nHenry VIII's children, King Edward VI and the future Queen Elizabeth I, spent their youth at Hatfield Palace. His eldest daughter, who later reigned as Queen Mary I, lived there between 1533 and 1536.\n\nThe [Queen Elizabeth Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_Oak,_Hatfield_House) on the grounds of the estate is said to be the location where Elizabeth was told she was queen aged 25 in 1558 following Mary I's death.\n\nHatfield House has many objects associated with Queen Elizabeth I, including gloves and a pair of silk stockings that are believed to have been the first in England. The library displays a 22-foot (6.7 m) long illuminated parchment roll showing the pedigree of the queen with ancestors back to Adam and Eve. The Marble Hall holds the \"[Rainbow Portrait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portraiture_of_Elizabeth_I_of_England#The_Rainbow_Portrait)\" of Elizabeth.\n\nHatfield House also has formal gardens and extensive grounds which you can walk around and contains many 500 year old oak trees.\n\nThe house and grounds have been used in countless films and T.V programmes, including: 'Sherlock Holmes' (2009), 'My Week with Marilyn' (2011), 'Paddington 2' (2017), 'Enola Holmes' (2020), the Netflix series 'Bridgerton' (2020) and 'The Crown' (2016).\n\n**Train tickets**\nGroupSave return tickets work out at £6.60 each (purchase on the day in groups of 3 when you turn up).

He bought the house to act as his family’s country refuge, a weekend and summer home which was away from his other home near Leicester Square.\n\nThe house tells the story of his life and works, he hated injustice, snobbery and deplored the degradation suffered by the poor. He was a benefactor of the Foundling Hospital, which was for orphaned and abandoned children. The house has been open to the public since 1904.\n\n**About Hogarth**\nPainter, satirist and social critic William Hogarth was born near Smithfield Market in London in 1697. He became an apprentice to a silver engraver as a teenager, which gave him the skills he later adapted to produce prints and to teach himself to paint.\n\nHogarth’s fame rests in particular on his series of pictures telling stories with contemporary real-life settings, his moral subjects such as ‘A Harlot’s Progress’ (original's destroyed in a fire in 1755), ‘A Rake’s Progress’ (can be seen in the Sir John Soanes Museum) and ‘Marriage-a-la-Mode’ (can be seen in the National Gallery). One of his best known images, ‘Gin Lane’, has come to represent the worst aspects of slum life in 18th century London.\n\nThe visit should last about 2 hours. The house is about a 20min walk from the station and on the way we will visit his statue and his grave.\n\nEntry to the house is free!\n\n**Afterwards**\nAfter we will head to the 'George & Devonshire pub' 8 Burlington Lane, a short walk from the house at 4pm for a chat over a drink.\n\nIf you can, please come to the pub afterwards, as its a great way to meet others after the visit.\n\nPlease note, we only wait outside the station for 10 minutes after the advertised meeting time, so please be early or on time.\n\nIf you can't see us outside the station, please text.\n\nLook out for the red & blue 'London Cultureseekers' group sign.\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nRobert\n07905 901 834 (text only)\n\nPlease make sure you are aware of the group rules here before RSVPing - [https://www.meetup.com/London_Cultureseekers/pages/26449165/Group_Rules/](https://www.meetup.com/London_Cultureseekers/pages/26449165/Group_Rules/)",
