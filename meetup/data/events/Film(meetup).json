I’m gonna give you the best seat in the house!” – Ashley\n\nAs much as I enjoyed *Malibu Express*, I assumed all the other movies in Andy Sidaris’ *Triple B Series* would taper off in quality. Well, I’m glad to say that this one is slightly better than its predecessor.\n\nI think a lot of that has to do with this one embracing its comedic elements even more and being pretty over-the-top with the more bonkers shit.\n\nIt also helps that this film features Harold Diamond, who was always enjoyable in the movies he did with a similar cult action director, Amir Shervan.\n\nWhile you could write this off as more of the same, I liked the buddy-action approach, as well as dumping in more Playboy Playmates and sexiness.\n\nThat being said, this did look a bit cheaper than the film before it. That doesn’t necessarily make it worse in that regard, it just made it so that the special effects people had to get more creative and they certainly did and succeeded. But you also have to suspend disbelief when the one dude is using a bazooka pretty recklessly but that just makes this picture more fun and absurd, in a great way.\n\nThis is absolutely a cheesy action movie but it’s also supposed to be. It felt like Sidaris was self-aware after making just one film and he took advantage of that, giving us a flick that didn’t try to pretend it was something better than it was. It knew its limitations but turned them into amusing strengths.

According to George Miller — master purveyor of carmaggedon turned pioneer of talking pig movies — this is the extent of what you can expect to find after nuclear war has reduced society to rubble. These are also the magnificent contents of a sequel that betters its predecessor (the shoestring stuntfest/personal revenge movie that was Mad Max) addressing the post-apocalyptic scenario with a punk rock sensibility and creating a grungy future chic and which propeled Mel Gibson to superstardom. And there was, of course, a further sequel, the inferior but interesting Beyond Thunderdome which made the mistake of diluting Max's darkness (concentrating on his journey back to himself).\n\nObsessed with his furious highspeed demolition derby, Miller structures a very linear plot in Mad Max 2 — you could happily describe it as one long chase scene (but there is a little more than that). Since the events that turned Max Roxatansky, well, mad there has been a total global apocalypse leaving the world stark and empty and startling like the desert badlands of New South Wales. Here a bad gang (led by the towering, bemasked Lord Houmungus (Nilsson) besieges a good gang, led by the idealistic naivete of Papagallo (Michael Preston) who have an oil refinery and therefore the new gold: petrol.\n\nTRAILER\nhttps://youtu.be/UlwtiOyaoo0\n\nCINEMA TICKETS\n£14 regular or £11 for PCC members.\nBook here for 4.35pm screening: https://princecharlescinema.com/PrinceCharlesCinema.dll/Booking?Booking=TSelectItems.waSelectItemsPrompt.TcsWebMenuItem_0.TcsWebTab_0.TcsPerformance_23565641.TcsSection_18488279\n\nDRINKS\nWe can go for a drink before the movie.\n\nSCHEDULE\n3.00pm - drinks\nFilm starts at 4:35pm\n\nADDRESSES\nPrince Charles Cinema 7 Leicester Pl, London WC2H 7BY\nRead less","dateTime":"2022-07-10T15:00+01:00","duration":"PT3H15M","host":{"id":"88107062","name":"Darren B"},"group":{"id":"36414279","name":"Prince Charles Cinema Social Group","urlname":"prince-charles-cinema-social-group"},"venue":{"lat":51.511494,"lng":-0.130446,"city":"London","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"7 Leicester Place, WC2H 7BY"}},{"id":"286782752","title":"\"SALO, OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM\" (1975) @PCC + DRINKS ","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/prince-charles-cinema-social-group/events/286782752","description":"Welcome to this meet up.

She’s like Elizabeth Taylor in drag, full meltdown, hysteria and hilarity under her considerable bosom. And as ever, the inimitable Edith Massey provides adorable support as bestie Cuddles Kovinsky.\n\nInitially, according to Waters, Divine was resistant to the role of frustrated housewife Francine Fishpaw. She found the costumes and greasy black wig less than glamorous. but it was the prospect of kisses from seasoned matinee pin-up Tab Hunter that changed her mind, and she insisted on many retakes… Strictly for accuracy’s sake, you understand!\n\nThe storyline is full of the obligatory dramatic tropes: Francine is trapped in a loveless marriage to pornographer Elmer (David Samson) her disco crazed daughter Lu Lu (Mary Garlington) is pregnant and son Dexter (Ken King) is skipping school to cause footstomping mayhem. Surely love interest Todd can save her? Of COURSE not! This is John Waters, bitches!!! And when it all falls apart, it’s actually genuinely affecting. You can’t help but feel for poor, misguided Francine.\n\nWhat elevates this, apart from the typical trashy lunacy of our moustachioed hero’s script, is the addition of Odorama, the scratch and sniff card, a homage to sensation cinema of the sixties, from the likes of William Castle.\n\nWaters was always unique: this satirical eighties gem, having a pop at the religious right, teen violence and souring suburban life, is not to be sniffed at. And electronic cut -and- pasters The Avalanches sampled Divine cooing, ‘Surely EXPULSION is not the answer!’ on their cult track *Frontier Psychiatrist.* You gotta love it, flammable synthetic fabrics and all.\n\nTRAILER\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrAkQ923Wk0\n\nSCHEDULE BREAKDOWN\n6:00 - Drinks upstairs at Genesis Cinema\n6.40 - Film\n\nADDRESS AND DETAILS\n93-95 Mile End Rd\nLondon E1 4UJ","dateTime":"2022-08-25T18:00+01:00","duration":"PT2H15M","host":{"id":"88107062","name":"Darren B"},"group":{"id":"36414279","name":"Prince Charles Cinema Social Group","urlname":"prince-charles-cinema-social-group"},"venue":{"lat":51.52114,"lng":-0.051122,"city":"London","country":"gb","postalCode":"E1 4UJ","address":"93-95 Mile End Road"}},{"id":"287282062","title":"INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM @ PCC + DRINKS","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/prince-charles-cinema-social-group/events/287282062","description":"**PREMISE**\nAdventure sequel.

Pretentious codswallop? Quite probably. For devotees, however, it is nonetheless compulsive viewing.

You then find out if you were right, or if you just murdered an innocent human.\n\nDuring the night phase, the werewolves secretly decide on who dinner is that evening. That person is then killed.\n\nThis cycle of day and night continues until either all the werewolves are dead, or the werewolves equal the villagers in numbers.

Here's a short video on very roughly how it plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P6mgLUde48\n\nEveryone is living together in a nice peaceful village, well, until werewolves start eating people of a night time. And the most impolite thing? Some of the villagers are actually the werewolves! Rude.\n\nThe game runs in phases, the day phase and the night phase. During the day phase, everyone discusses who they think is suspicious and might be a hidden furbag. They then vote on that person and if the village agrees they're a werewolf, they are immediately killed! You then find out if you were right, or if you just murdered an innocent human.\n\nDuring the night phase, the werewolves secretly decide on who dinner is that evening. That person is then killed.\n\nThis cycle of day and night continues until either all the werewolves are dead, or the werewolves equal the villagers in numbers. Don't worry though, there are some special villagers who will have abilities to help you root out these hairy pests!\n\nDon't worry, it's really very simple and I'll explain fully on the night.\n\nThe only requirements to play are that you have a pen and paper to write on, or preferably a thick marker pen as you may need to show names to the zoom camera. Alternatively you can use an app on your phone like \"Large Text\" in android or \"MEGATEXT Led Banner Text\" in iOS. We'll be aiming to start the game around 7:15pm at the latest so please try to be on time.","dateTime":"2020-11-10T19:00Z","duration":"PT2H","host":{"id":"4359158","name":"Derek"},"group":{"id":"32137170","name":"The Constant Readers Book Club: All Things Stephen King","urlname":"The-Constant-Readers-Book-Club"},"venue":{"lat":51.510937,"lng":-0.128009,"city":"","country":"","postalCode":"","address":""}},{"id":"273636146","title":"'Salem's Lot (First Session)","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/the-constant-readers-book-club/events/273636146","description":"A quote from the man himself about 'Salem's Lot, his 2nd published novel:\n\"In a way it is my favorite story, mostly because of what it says about small towns.

The eyes are the windows to the soul, so it’s a lot easier to have a mesmerizing conversation with someone after you’ve spent two minutes looking into his or her eyes. That is the simple idea behind Eye Gazing Parties. Banal chit-chat about employment status, the location of your apartment, or where you’re from is not a great way to spark a captivating connection with an alluring new person. Eye contact is.\n\nHere’s how it works. An even number of singles gets together in an attractive space. After a fun mini-lesson in the art of eye contact, the group splits into pairs, and each pair spends two minutes looking at each other’s eyes, no talking, with inviting beats in the background. The pairs switch up every two minutes, for a total of forty-five minutes. Then there’s a party afterward, with drinks flowing and luscious beats vibing. You can talk with everyone you met gazing to get to know each other even better and exchange information with potential dates. The eye gazing has an electrifying effect on the party. Simply put, two minutes of eye contact is the Cadillac of ice-breakers.\n\nEye Gazing Parties were invented by Michael Ellsberg and have been featured in the New York Times, CNN, Good Morning America, Match.com, Nerve.com, MSNBC, the BBC, and in Tim Ferriss’s #1 New York Times bestseller The Four-Hour Workweek (pp. 60-61). Elle magazine called Eye Gazing Parties “New York’s hottest dating trend.” They’ve happened across America and in Australia, Singapore, and Budapest!\n\nEntry:  £6 on the door\n\nOr book online for £5 at:\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Silent-Speed-Dating-Eye-Gazing-Parties/\n\nTo be kept up to date with any last minute changes it is best you register for this event at\n\nhttp://www.meetup.com/Silent-Speed-Dating-Eye-Gazing-Parties/","dateTime":"2011-06-14T19:00+01:00","duration":"PT0S","host":null,"group":{"id":"1403494","name":"Chillout London","urlname":"ChillOutLondon"},"venue":{"lat":51.53949,"lng":-0.143659,"city":"London NW1 7HJ","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"12 Inverness Street"}},{"id":"24432751","title":"Friday Evening Meetup @ Revolution (on Leadenhall Street)","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/chilloutlondon/events/24432751","description":"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/f/3/event_26039891.jpeg\n\nHi Guys,\nJoin us for a Friday evening Meetup at the Revolution bar on Leadenhall Street, in Central London.\n\nEntry Rates:\n\nIts Free befor 8pm and £5 to £10 after 8pm\n\nMusic:\n\nThe most eclectic mix in the City from Chart Anthems & Dance to Electro, Hip Hop and Indie - Anything goes!\n\nDress code:\n\nPlease note that they don’t normally let you in with ‘trainers’.\n\nRevolution Leadenhall operates a smart/casual dress code.

You can register at following link so stay updated on relevent events and see other RSVPs: https://www.meetup.com/investing-trading-macroeconomics-financial-markets/\n\n**Some potential market impacting themes & latest hot global political & economic developments to ponder:**\n\n1. Central banks tightening and implications for global asset prices (stocks, currencies, crypto, commodities, bond yields, property) and outlook for inflation & economic growth.\n2. Current valuations, risk of market crash and prolonged bear market for the major indices. The biggest \"everything bubble\" since 2000 finally began to unwind Q4 2021 with Nasdax down -30% & some tech stocks down -90%. How more low could we go? A lot lower than people think.\n3. My proprietary indicators are forecating a global slowdown in earnings so I see fair value for stocks at much lower mutiples (PE) fulled partly by higher business costs whilst ponzinomics cryptos intrinsic value worth close to zero though - given high volatility - ok for short term trade but watch out below. Japan is now even more fucked with their failed 30 year QE experiment delivering a 50 year low valueless Yen. Is a FX mean reversion trade worth a punt? With the Euro near dollar parity is the failed EU project likely to follow suit soon?\n4. Geo political events including but not limited to Russian invasion, financial sanctions and spillovers to global markets and economies.\n5. As a US presidential candidate on the campaign trail once mocked the incumbent: \"it's the economy - stupid\". My leading indicators predicting major contraction if not outright global recession. Apart from the Bank of England, are the ECB/Fed in denial? The 3000+ Phd economists can't all be useless or maybe it's just Jay? Never get a lawyer whose decisions negatively effect billions globally to do a real man's job (what was congress/ president thinking appointing him and for that matter Yellen & Bernanke who have never worked in the real world either).\n6. Market Sentiment & Earnings. Spurred by recency bias, it seems many who never invested in a pre GFC regime have been buying the dips. Beware of the high correlation between growth slowdown & lower company earnings / misses (minus share buybacks). Yes sentiment/investor pyschology can matter short term but profitability ultimately drive prices, even extreme oversold signals on technicals can lose predictive value depending on market regime & levels of risk aversion.\n7. Depth of policy tightening & credibility reassertion. Economists pricing in rates to 3.5% along with QT. If inflation persists will a deep global recession be the price we have to pay? Many expect Fed pivot but with inflation forecasts nowhere near target & unemployment well below level considered consisitent with price stability (NAIRU), why would they? This is not 2012 nor 2018 - the only thing that has pivoted is the economic paradigm with nearest parallels - UK/US/Europe in 70s/80s. Asset price mandate doesn't exist, the best empirical evidence shows long term growth suffers and the poor get even poorer. Don't Fight the Fed\n8. UK interest rate rises / monetary policy tightening and implications for house prices & economy. Looks like we're heading into recession soon (or already in one). BOE's governer blaming everything from Ukraine to sunspot activity at the annoyance of the MPC hawks! If Liz Truss becomes new PM we could see a shift in the economic strategy forcing even higher rates crushing house prices\n9. Risks from new Covid variants and macro impact. What's going on with China lockdown of cities like Shanghai? Something not right - ulterior motives to cripple global economy & further add to supply constraints to aid Putin's war? Who knows - as Philosopher Socrates once graciously said \"I know nothin\".

We'll try to touch on the empirical literature/evidence for paranormal phenomena & potential explanations including ( I can share research studies with you) :\n\n\\- Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?\n\n\\- Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" \\(quantum entanglement\\) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?\n\n\\- What existed before the universe \\(big bang\\) \\- how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play and suggest about unknown dimensions and out understanding of entwined space and time?\n\n\"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking once said. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?\n\n\\- Is the near death experieince phenomena millions have experienced a result of neurochemical and hormonal changes that occur in the body & brain close to death \\(esp\\. in truma conditions\\) or something beyond physicality?\n\n\\- Given neuroscience research is in it's infancy relative to other areas of medicine/science and so there is yet still so little understanding of the brain\\, could mediation help to access additional functions that are not available when we are operate in BAU alpha\\, beta and gamma brainwaves phases?\n\n\\- As well as the brain \\- studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons\\. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in Last Christmas?\n\nThe smartest philsoophers and scientists know we will never know the real truth but can we employ any experimental and other practical empirical techniques to get there? An approach guided by Immanuel Kant's pragamatism & Aristotle's deductive reasoning seems the most optimal epistemology here but is there any other methodologies?\n\n=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================\nWe'll meet inside The Zodiac Bar in Camden.

That why we are teaming up with Socialite Connections & sister groups to put on an anti-valentines neutral free event. This will not only discourage people turning up to explore coping off opportunities especially with vulnerable women feeling the pressure of superficial days like this. Tonight will just be a social but freindly event all centered around having fun highly engaging conversations and laughs over a drink or two.\n\nSo if you think this day is a fake - and you're also looking for your 1 in 500,000 person rather than just someone and are not deluded enougth to think you'll meet them at a singles group or during the week of Feb 14 then tonight will be for you!! We recognise it's a workday after probably a heavy alcohol infused weekend so we're not proposing a party - just something light to fill your evening in case you don't want to be on your own or you just wanna get away from your partner for the night (we completely understand!)\n\n=====Venue & Plan====\nOn arrival, tell door security that the reservation is booked under Socialite Connections / Michelle & Lucas. You will be directed to the VIP area. Free pizza will served at 9pm for everyone to share.\n\nThis is a JOIN EVENT run in conjunction with other groups (led by Michelle) so the number of collective RSVPs/attendees is much higher then what you see on the list.

To accompany their chilled out 'lounge' feel, they have an affordable brunch menu with something for everyone (I’m thinking pancakes myself) and great Italian coffee. They’ve also very kindly offered a glass of a champagne & orange (bucks fizz) with every brunch, to kick off our catchup in style.\n\nStaines has excellent public transport links by train and bus, and there’s also plenty of parking (although it does get busy Saturday mornings).

It truly is a marvel.\n\nWe can start from a quieter corner of the park, where there is free parking, and do a circuit via the Savill Garden Gallery Café. (To actually get inside Savill Garden itself is charged, so we can save that for another date if there is enough interest). We'll aim for a 3 mile walk in total, and the café is halfway. It should take around 40 minutes to get to the café and another 30 - 40 minutes back (depending how enthused we're feeling and off the 'track' we want to go). The walk will take us passed the famous polo pitches - which is an incredible open space and in fact where the Prince of Wales (who became King Edward VIII) learnt to fly, and during World War II it was used as a take-off strip for various small military aircraft. And we'll walk back via Chapel Wood and Cow Pond. Chapel wood is filled with amazing Japanese Maples and witch hazel, and Cow Pond (as the name does NOT reflect) is an ornamental lake gilded with an abundance of water lilies - it really is stunning!\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/d/7/600_455980663.jpeg\n\nRather than meeting in the cold, we'll meet in the Fox and Hounds pub (http://www.thefoxandhoundsrestaurant.com/) next to the entrance of the park. There is parking outside the pub and a little further down closer to the entrance of the park. Of course, should the weather be absolutely hideous, we'll just stay in the Fox and Hounds for a coffee (hopefully cake) and a good natter!\n\nRegarding dogs - I LOVE dogs and so am more than happy to have dogs on the walk. The website, however, isn't very clear if dogs are allowed in the café. They are clearly not allowed in the restaurant (which is in the same building). This is what I've found on the website:\nWell behaved dogs on leads are welcome in The Savill Building Gift shop and on the terrace, excluding the restaurant. Water bowls are available on request on the terrace, and water is also available outside Virginia Water Pavilion - but dogs are not allowed inside the Pavilion. Dogs are not allowed in The Savill Garden, and must be kept on leads in the following locations:\nThe Savill Building\n\nIf you'd like to bring a dog inside the café, the best thing might be to give the venue a quick call and ask about the \"Gallery Café\" specifically: 01784 485 402 or email enquiries@windsorgreatpark.co.uk\n\nReally looking forward to seeing you all. Any questions, let me know! Best wishes,\n\nCharlie\n\np.s. oh.. and if you'd like to bring your horse, there's a dedicated area to tie up horses outside the Horse and Hounds, plus water and hay on hand so that your mount can fuel up!\n\njust joking... don't actually bring any horses...","dateTime":"2016-12-04T10:30Z","duration":"PT0S","host":{"id":"204880130","name":"Charlie Bradley Ross"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":51.439144,"lng":-0.583718,"city":"Egham","country":"gb","postalCode":"TW20 0XU","address":"Bishops Gate, Englefield Green"}},{"id":"236039797","title":"Signs of Christmas","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/236039797","description":"Hi Ladies!

Your shoes can make a big difference. For ladies we suggest a shoe style with a small heel, leather sole, ankle straps, and an enclosed toe for comfort. Smooth soles will help you to pivot easily.

You will understand the basics of manipulating this fabulous 3D material and create a relief of a leaf that you can take home and keep. All refreshments will be included, so just bring yourselves. Aprons and gloves will be provided to help protect clothing but you are recommended to wear suitable comfortable clothing.\nThe cost per person will be £15 and this covers all materials.\nThere is limited space, so please book as soon as you can here to reserve your spot: http://www.surreyartschool.com/autumn-classes/plastertaster\nIf the session is full, please do add your name to the waiting list on this page, as if anyone can't make it, they may be able to forward their ticket on to you.\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/5/9/600_457422329.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/5/5/d/600_457422333.jpeg\n\n- - -\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/9/d/600_457058813.jpeg\n\nIn the hustle of life, it’s easy for our mental and emotional health to take a backseat. Most of us get sidetracked by errands, job, kids, cooking, cleaning .. dare I go on (?!) You may think it's mumbo jumbo, but it's been proven that creative activities are literally therapy for the mind, so when I came across Ellie and the Surrey Art School at a recent craft fair and we got chatting about her beautiful farm-based art studio and classes... I pretty much fell in love. I was soooo delighted when she offered to put on our very own class!\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/a/b/600_457058827.jpeg\n\nShe's still concocting a fab afternoon for us, so the activity is tbc, but I wanted to make sure you had it in your diaries in plenty of time. Ellie is also putting on the session for an absolute steal price of £20 per person, so please do take advantage of an amaaaazing afternoon treat with an incredibly generous discount! Of course, I'll update details as I know more.\n\nAnd if you need any more convincing... here are five proven ways that creativity is the key to better mental and emotional health:\n\n1. It relieves stress\n\n2. It increases and renews brain function\n\n3. It can help prevent Alzheimer's\n\n4. It improves mood\n\n5. It cultivates your social life ...

So let's seize the moment with a fabulous, long walk and take in some of the wilds and wonders of leafy Surrey.\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/5/1/600_457719249.jpeg\n\nDuring our last brunch, we had a good natter about the various forms of exercise (or lack of) we do. Well, great news ladies, walking can be more effective than running! Music to my ears! Scientists in California, found that walking reduces the risk of heart disease by 9.3%, while running reduces it by 4.5%. Aaaaand walking helps you sleep better and feel more alert during the day... so we can take on Monday morning head first. Yes.\n\nIf you're new to the group and haven't yet come along to a meetup, this is a great opportunity to get to know us gals in a relaxed, informal environment. Please don't be nervous - all of the ladies are incredibly friendly, warm and welcoming. And also don't worry AT ALL that you won't be able to keep up - if anyone is struggling, we'll slow the pace right down so that everyone is comfortable and we won't leave anyone behind!!! I'm just really excited to see new faces and find out all about what you do.\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/6/4/600_457719268.jpeg\n\nRoute\n\nLisa has really really reeeeally kindly offered to plan the walk, starting from Guildford train station. It will be no more than 6 to 7 miles. That's roughly 3 to 4 hours walking, with a few hours for lunch and pitstops. In terms of fitness - a good bill of health is required, but we'll go at a relaxed pace (I certainly won't be running it!!)\n\nFood\n\nWe'll plan a lunch stop on the route, so bring a scrummy lunch, drinks and snacks to keep you going. We'll also stop in a pub at the end - to reward our hard earned effort.\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/8/7/600_457719303.jpeg\n\nWhat To Bring Suggestions\n\nWater - Around 1 litre.\n\nFood - Snack items and/or sandwiches. Anything that's easy to grab and eat while you walk and that you don't mind getting crushed in a bag. Granola bars, energy bars, and trail mixes are good. Don't bring tooooo much (around 500 calories is recommended for this sort of walk).\n\nShoes - Comfortable shoes. It's likely to be muddy, so I'd recommend hiking boots with good tread and ankle support.\n\nClothing - Double check the weather. It may rain, in which case you'll want a warm rain jacket with a hood and maybe waterproof trousers if you have them.\n\nBackpack - Not compulsory but I'd bring one if you have one. Don't feel obliged to fill it with stuff -- the more you pack, the more there is to carry!\n\nFirst Aid Basics - I doubt we'll need these, but always handy in an emergency. Benadryl for unexpected allergic reactions. Hand sanitiser. Plasters. Tissues.\n\nMisc Items - Camera, sunglasses, sunscreen, hat (for sun and/or rain).\n\nSome Additional Things To Remember\n\nLNT - Leave No Trace! Follow outdoor ethics and planning.\n\nAllergies - If you have any severe allergies, eg bees, food, or medications, let everyone know as soon as you can, so we're all aware. This is just a precaution in case you have an allergic reaction or become injured (and so we don't all bring peanut butter sandwiches if you're allergic to peanuts!).\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/7/2/600_457719282.jpeg","dateTime":"2017-02-26T10:00Z","duration":"PT3H","host":{"id":"204880130","name":"Charlie Bradley Ross"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":51.242722,"lng":-0.589514,"city":"Surrey","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"Surrey"}},{"id":"237194612","title":"Dinner with Omid Djalili","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/237194612","description":"The Peacocks Centre, 1st Floor, Woking, GU21 6GQ\n\n... made you look.\n\nMore accurately: Let's go for dinner and then catch Omid Djalili's new show \"Schmuck for a Night\" in Woking!\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/3/600_457801923.jpeg\n\nI'm a HUUUUUGE fan of Omid Djalili.

Listening to classical music can:\n\nDecrease stress levels: Music can trigger positive chemical reactions in the brain which help reduce stress and depression. Some also claim that the act of hearing music has as great an impact physiologically as having a massage (wowza).\n\nBoost brain power: Known as the “Mozart effect”, students perform better in tests if they listen to classical music, can complete them more quickly, and improve their IQ over time.\n\nImprove quality of sleep: Sleep patterns are improved significantly when you spend 45 minutes before bed listening to classical music.\n\nEase chronic pain (which hopefully none of us have!): Music speeds up the process of healing tissue. It also can distract the brain from focusing on chronic physical pain.\n\nImprove memory and prevent degeneration: Hearing a piece of classical music can enhance the activity of the genes which regulate dopamine secretion and memory, while reducing those affecting neuro-degeneration.\n\nSo not only are we supporting the fabulously lovely Rebecca in her performance, AND sneakily getting two orchestras for the price of one, but there are also a ton of other great benefits too.\n\nThe programme will include:\n\nWasps Overture - Vaughan Williams\nPrince Igor Overture - Borodin\nMalaguena - arr Sammy Nestico\nDanse Bacchanale - Saint-Saens\nBuglers' Holiday - Leroy Anderson\n\nGuilford Sinfonia's Set (Rebecca on violin):\nThe Carousel Waltz - Richard Rogers\nRadetzky-March - Johann Strauss (you'll recognise it from New Years concerts!)\nAnnen-Polka - Johann Strauss\nThunder and Lightning - Johann Strauss\nGold and Silver\nChariots of Fire\nGladiator\nA 007 medley (just for something different!)\n\nCost\n\n£8 (£6 concessions) on the door\n\nLocation\n\n6.00pm Pub - The Herbert Wells (I don't know the area too well, so any other suggestions welcome! Just saw this has good reviews on trip advisor and nice and close to the venue :)\n\n7.30 Concert:\nHG Wells Church Street East\nWoking\nSurrey\nGU21 6HJ\n\nParking: Victoria way car park is the closest and has a covered walkway across to the centre at (I think) level 4, or you can cross the road and enter from ground level as well. https://www.woking.gov.uk/transport/parking/carparks/victoriaway\n\nTimes\nThe concert starts at 7.30, so we'll meet beforehand at 6pm for a sneaky drink before going in and grabbing a bite for anyone who's hungry.\n\nI'm unbelievably excited about this, and so buuuursting to see Rebecca (it's embarrassing). Always incredibly excited to meet new people, so please don't be shy to come along if you've not been before. We'd be thrilled to meet you.\n\nAny questions - let us know!!\nCharlie (& Rebecca)","dateTime":"2017-03-18T19:30Z","duration":"PT2H","host":{"id":"204880130","name":"Charlie Bradley Ross"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":51.320599,"lng":-0.557567,"city":"Surrey","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"Woking, GU21 6HJ"}},{"id":"236821781","title":"Lindy hop in Windsor (with fab intro discount!)","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/236821781","description":"What better way to let our hair down after a long week than learning to dance original swing and jive with Swingland!\n\nLindy hop is the original style of partnered swing and jive dancing... and basically looks absolutely amazing.

Over the last 30 years, swing dancing has been enjoying a global renaissance. London has been one of the major cities driving this revival - and it's now spreading rapidly from town to town across the country.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/myJj0mNNe1Y\n\nWho Are Swingland?\n\nEstablished in 1998, Swingland is a leading and well-respected swing dancing school and swing dance and music promoter based in the London area. The Windsor classes are taught by Swingland founder Martin Ellis and his wife Ruth, with Rosie Skinner helping when Ruth is unavailable.\n\nYou can see teachers Martin & Ruth dancing here for their wedding dance (totally not choreographed... amazing!!):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/_wstpHYwRuE\n\n7pm: MEET IN THE BAR\n\nWe'll meet in the bar first at 7pm - for a quick chat and some refreshments. The Firestation also does food for anyone who would like a quick bite.\n\n8pm-9pm: BEGINNERS CLASS\n\nThen we'll move into the hall where we'll begin the lesson. We'll learn all the basics with simple fun routines aimed at getting us dancing quickly - with plenty of emphasis on good lead and follow technique and connection. Absolute beginners always welcome. No partner needed!\n\n9-9.30pm: PRACTICE\n\nThen the floor opens for social dancing and practice from 9pm - 9.30pm.\n\n9.30 'TIL CLOSE (midnight)\n\nAnd of course, we can sit in the bar until close once we've kicked the dancing shoes off! ... then again, they may come back on again depending on what's playing (...bring on Beyoncé is all I can say).","dateTime":"2017-03-24T19:00Z","duration":"PT2H30M","host":{"id":"204880130","name":"Charlie Bradley Ross"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":51.470821,"lng":-0.629888,"city":"Windsor","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"St Leonards Road, Windsor SL4 3BL"}},{"id":"238795158","title":"Tale As Old As Time...","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/238795158","description":"(...the tale of wanting to see a totally girly chick flick that your bloke absolutely won't see with you even if you pay for him, buy extra popcorn and drive him there and back.)\n\nThat's right ladies!

The class is £10 for an hour - which really is a total steal for a one-off class. I told our lovely teacher that I'd gauge the uptake on here and we can take it from there. You don't need to buy anything in preparation for the class (although I'm desperate for a reason to buy some tap shoes and have a go)!\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/c/9/a/600_459739610.jpeg\n\nWhy Else Should You Come?\n\nTap dancing may be fun to watch and enjoyable to perform, but are there health benefits to a little clickety-clack? Turns out, there are! Benefits of tap dance include increasing cardiovascular conditioning, strength, flexibility, and coordination. Tap dance combinations build strength in the legs and feet in addition to increasing flexibility in the hips, knees and ankles. Cognitive abilities are also enhanced, as tap dancers develop both mental and muscle memory to become proficient at tapping. Besides.. an hour of tap is said to burn about 250 calories, so we're already winning.\n\nOf course, any form of dance helps to develop a great sense of rhythm and timing. It's also fantastic for developing balance - which builds core muscles, and in turn, reduces back pain, prevents injuries and improves posture.\n\nWhat keeps people coming back, however, is simpler: tap is noisy, energetic and fun.\n\nWhat Else?\n\nAs the class finishes at 7.30, that seems a good time to grab a drink and a bite to eat... and chat about how silly the class was. Of course, please feel free to just come for the dinner if you're not up for the tap.\n\nWhat to wear\n\nWear something that you can move in – Leggings, dance wear, sports wear – And either tap shoes (you can pick some up really cheap online or charity shops ... apparently) or comfortable non-marking trainers. Also don't forget your bottle of water!\n\nNew Ladies\n\nIf you're new to the group - don't be shy - we're basically brilliant. And everyone will make you feel totally welcome and at home.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you there!\n\np.s. does Ryan Gosling come with this class??","dateTime":"2017-05-19T18:30+01:00","duration":"PT1H","host":{"id":"204880130","name":"Charlie Bradley Ross"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":51.374222,"lng":-0.460323,"city":"KT13 8JD","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"Portmore Way, Weybridge"}},{"id":"239412715","title":"Cracking Cocktails and Caribbean (+10% off yowza)","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/239412715","description":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/c/c/8/600_460244232.jpeg\n\nSo I've been told my writeups may be a little long...\n\nSoooooo, the facts:\n\n- Cocktails + food at Turtle Bay.\n\n- We've got 10% off food (get in).\n\n- Elena and Maria say the cocktails are amAAAZing.\n\n- Food looks scrummy.

And have been looking into cycling routes in the great park! Apparently the Queen, lady of all ladies, is super strick on cyclist in her backyard so we must stick to permitted cyclist routes only :) and she dont like speeding either! So no fast daredevil acts allowed!\nLets meet directly at the bike hire place which is close to windsor station (www.extrememotion.com)\nAlexandra Gardens, Barry Avenue, SL4 5HZ\nFrom there we will cycle out of Windsor following national cycling trail/route into the great park. We will do a little loop passing Virgina Water where we can stop for ICE CREAM :) and then make our way to the Savills for our picknic!\nThey are also strict on where to leave bikes but there are some at the Savill so we must just see when we get there! Then after the picnic we will have an approx 30min cycle ride back to Windsor returning the bikes!\n\nPlease confirm you are joining the cycle ride and want to rent a bike to me!\nIMPORTANT INFO:\nThe bike hire place requires advance booking and also a deposit payment.\nThey only have a total of 16 bikes to rent out so we need to book it in fast as Saturdays are popular.\nBike hire cost: £18 for the day!\nI will be booking the bikes on Monday! Please if you could confirm by transferring the payment via paypal link (will send in separate email) that way i can take care of reserving the bikes and payment.\nEmail to follow!\n\nIf you're reading this after Monday theres still chance for you to join by checking with the bike rental if the still have a bike free or by bringing your own bike!! :)\n\nInspired by a discovery of the most beautiful picnic spot by the river and a conversation with Iris about a bike ride, we thought we'd combine the two!! Sooo the next meetup will be a picnic in absolutely gorgeous Windsor Great Park (https://www.windsorgreatpark.co.uk/en) with an optional bike ride beforehand. (Technically, both parts are optional... but I think you get the gist).\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/7/c/600_461342428.jpeg\n\nIf a photo of sweaty me beside the perfect picnic location doesn't persuade you.. I don't know what will.\n\nCycle Ride - 11am start\n\nIris and I thought it would be nice to get a bike ride in before our picnic. We're currently looking into bike-hire options. We'll confirm the meeting point beforehand - I was just keen to get this in the diary, and gauge cycling interest before we go in all guns blazing. So let us know if you're keen for the bike ride too. I'll be cycling there from Egham, and Iris will be driving from Godalming, so I'm sure we will meet somewhere with carpark access.\n\nPicnic Meeting - 1pm\n\nMeet outside the front entrance of the Savill Garden Cafe, as there is a carpark there. It does get incredibly busy, so I can't guarantee parking, however, there are quieter corners of the park where you can find more parking, and take a stroll to the meeting spot.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/9/6/600_461342454.jpeg\n\nThis could be you! Cycling through here!!\n\nBike Route - TBD\n\nPlanning on a slow one to two hours pootle around the park on the bikes. Currently, plan to meet at 11am and do a route ending at the Savill Garden Gallery Café at 1ish. I'm also very into cake and coffee stops... so will be persuading Iris to take us via a coffee hut if we can!\n\nPicnic Food & Drink\n\nSharing is caring! I think it works if we divvy up all of the items (including the \"non-food\" bits) a few days beforehand when we know the exact numbers coming. Some ideas:\n\nSandwiches\nPotato Salad (my personal fave)\nVeggies, Crisps and Dip\nPasta Salad\nDeviled Eggs\nCorn on the Cob\nRotisserie Chicken or Salami etc\nCheese and Crackers\nGarden Salad\nWaldorf Salad\nDeserts: Fresh Fruit, Cakes & Biccies etc\nDrinks: Water / Iced Tea / Lemonade / Wine / Beer\n\nAdditional extras (which I don't have):\n\nRug - essential on any picnic in my view!!\nTableware - cutlery, plates, cups, napkins\nCoolers for cold food and beverages\n\nFun Picnic Ideas\n\nEquipped with the above, we're totally ready to sit back, relax and enjoy a picture-perfect picnic! But if anyone has any of these fun additions, then do bring 'em along:\n\n- softball / rounders gear\n- frisbee\n- balls\n- board / card games\n\nOther Bits You Might Like\n\nCamera, sunglasses, sunscreen, sun hat, hand sanitiser, tissues.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/b/2/600_461342482.jpeg\n\nSome Additional Things To Remember\n\nLNT - Leave No Trace! Follow outdoor ethics and planning.\n\nAllergies - If you have any severe allergies, eg bees, food, or medications, let everyone know as soon as you can so we're all aware. This is just a precaution in case you have an allergic reaction or become injured (and so we don't all bring peanut butter sandwiches if you're allergic to peanuts!).\n\nDiets - Similarly, if you're vegan, gluten intolerant, vegetarian etc, please let the group know as soon as possible, so we can bring enough for you to eat.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/5/600_461342533.jpeg\n\nDogs\n\nI LOVE dogs, but I don't think it's ideal on this occasion, unless you have a dog that won't dive into our picnics or at small children passing by. Also we won't be walking anywhere and I think they also have to be kept on leads in this area of the park, which isn't much fun for them.\n\nIf You'd Like To Come\n\nI'm making a stand and going for watsapp only.

Please do get there for 11.30 (if not 11.15) as getting all our gear ready and sorting out wetsuits etc will take some time.\n\nTo book your spot call The Quays Wake and Ski directly on:\n01252 524 375.

Of course hoping we wont need them and that the weather will be awesome!!! :)\n\nHow to get there:\nThis place is accessible by car of course so car-sharing could be ideal!

Following the fabulous success of our Creative Arty Session (https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/236404988/) a few months ago, Ellie, Founder of The Surrey Art School, has been planning a secret afternoon just for us gals. I'm thrilled to announce the full line up for this absolutely incredible private afternoon...\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/9/7/600_461609079.jpeg\n\nA Sunday afternoon of peace, relaxation, creativity and reflection at the gorgeous Surrey Hills Yurts, Dorking.\n\nImportant: This session has a capacity of 15 people on a first paid, first reserved basis. Don't be disappointed if you miss a slot - if we have an additional 10 on the waitinglist, that should be enough for Ellie to cover the cost for a second teacher!\n\nTime: 1.00pm-3.30pm\n\nCost: £35. Again, Ellie has put this whole thing together for an unbelieeeevable steal for us. So do take advantage of it!!\n\nBookings here: http://www.surreyartschool.com/private-event/\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/c/a/600_461609130.jpeg\n\nSchedule Overview:\n\n• Mindful fire-lighting and cup of tea reception\n\n• Fire-side drawing and wild-life drawing\n\n• Outdoor tutor led mono-printing workshop\n\n• Gin tasting and nibbles - sample local Surrey Gins whilst you drink in the glorious views of the Surrey landscape\n\n• Tea and coffee - available throughout in the fab outdoor kitchen\n\nOptional:\n\n• 5 minute shoulder massages or longer sessions available in one of the cosy yurts onsite (I don't know about you, but after a stressful work week I'm defo in for this!!!)\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/1/e/f/600_461609167.jpeg\n\nAbout The Day\n\nAs you can see, this workshop is totally packed with fabulousness.\n\nTea & Fire Lighting: I've never really thought about it, but there's something pretty powerful about tea. Tea's the first thing I think about after a long stressful day at work, it's the first thing I offer a visitor passing through (unless it's Loren, and it's prosecco all the way) - it's basically the silent peace maker in my cupboard. I also recently read about a group that brings together people of different genders, ages and cultures, over a cup of tea, to bridge our differences. And that's pretty cool.\n\nThroughout art history and from a spiritual perspective, fire is said to represent our passions, compulsions, zeal, creativity and motivation. Fire, by its nature, forges will and determination, and in Greek philosophy is tied to both passion and power. Now, I'm not a terribly spiritual person, but there is something pretty beautiful (and generally awesome) about lighting a fire ... and if it's getting me any closer to being passionate, motivated and powerful - I'm going full bonfire.\n\nFire-Side Drawing : I've not drawn anything in forever, so I'm really excited to get back to nature and just get a pen on paper! So we'll be taking our inspiration from the plants, nature and farm animals (weyhey) and drawing from observation.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/3/3/600_461609235.jpeg\n\nMono Print: Then we'll learn how to create unique mono-prints, transforming natural objects and our drawings into beautiful prints to keep or give as gifts. This is a simple, but effective technique and we'll leave with lots of beautiful goodies to take home again too.\n\nGin Tasting & Nibbles: I didn't realise, but we have a few gin distilleries right on our doorstep - I feel another meetup date forming! - but in the meantime, we'll have some scrummy local Surrey Gins to sample in the glorious Surrey landscape... that's almost enough of a meetup on its own!\n\nMassages: We've been really lucky and Ellie has managed to grab a spare yurt so they will also be offering cheap shoulder or full massages in one of the vacant yurts during the session too. What an absolute treat!!\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/0/f/600_461609199.jpeg\n\n- - -\n\nLocation: I couldn't be more excited about the location - a beautiful, eco-friendly, luxury yurt site set in the Surrey Hills, an hour from central London. With 15 acres and a working farm set in an area of \"Outstanding Natural Beauty\", I can't wait to spend some time in this breathtaking part of the world. (And meet some gorgeous Sussex Cows, Gloucester Old Spots pigs and chickens on the way around too!)\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/5/7/600_461609271.jpeg\n\nI believe you can also purchase products from the farm shop - including free range eggs and meat, and Gloucester Old Spots weaners (I don't know what these are, but they're available all year round).\n\nCost: The cost per person is £35 and this covers all materials. All you need is yourself.\n\nBooking: As I mentioned, there is limited space, so please book as soon as you can here to reserve your spot: http://www.surreyartschool.com/private-event/ To pay using a different method, or for any other questions, feel free to contact Ellie directly:\n\nEmail: surreyartschool@gmail.com\nCall: 07861761167\n\nIf the session is full, please let me know and I'll add your name to the waiting list on this page. That way, if anyone can't make it, they may be able to forward their ticket on to you.\n\n- - -\n\nWhy Get Creative?\n\nIn the hustle of life, it’s easy for our mental and emotional health to take a backseat. Most of us get sidetracked by errands, job, kids, cooking, cleaning .. dare I go on (?!) You may think it's mumbo jumbo, but it's been proven that creative activities are literally therapy for the mind, so when I came across Ellie and the Surrey Art School at a craft fair and we got chatting about her beautiful farm-based art studio and classes... I pretty much fell in love. I was soooo delighted when she offered to put on our very own class in a beautiful yurt.\n\nAnd if you need any more convincing... here are five proven ways that creativity is the key to better mental and emotional health:\n\n1. It relieves stress\n\n2. It increases and renews brain function\n\n3. It can help prevent Alzheimer's\n\n4. It improves mood\n\n5. It cultivates your social life ... (and that's where we all come in!)\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/2/6/6/600_461609286.jpeg\n\nGetting There\n\nIt is a little adventure to get there, but I'm hoping we have enough ladies who are willing to carpool and share the cost of the petrol for those of us without cars (ahem... like me!)\n\nThere's a great description on getting to the venue on the yurts website:\n\nhttps://surreyhillsyurts.co.uk/contact-us\n\n(n.b. there won't be the pickups from dorking station as described on their \"travelling by rail\" tab, so we will have to carpool or taxi for the 10 minute drive). We can discuss routes on the watsapp group.\n\nI'm so delighted that Ellie has put all of this together for us, so I really hope you love it too. I can't wait to see you there and, as always, new faces very much welcomed!\n\nI'll be organising all of this on watsapp, so message me your number if I haven't got it already.\n\nAny questions, let me know!\n\nCharlie","dateTime":"2017-07-16T13:00+01:00","duration":"PT2H30M","host":{"id":"204880130","name":"Charlie Bradley Ross"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":51.214729,"lng":-0.362787,"city":"RH4 3JN","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"Mad Horse Copse, Logmore Lane Westcott, Dorking"}},{"id":"241244544","title":"Walk & Pilates on top of Box Hill","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/241244544","description":"What is better than a full day outside enjoying beautiful views and great company while burning off some calories???\n\nMe and a friend (Elena who happens to be a professional pilates instructor) over coffee came up with this amazing idea! To combine a walk, pilates and amazing views!\n\nI have found the perfect walk which takes us through the Denbies, Ranmore and Box Hill! We will enjoy gorgeous views, green slopes, woodland trail, vineyard trail, the stepping stones and long climb up box hill(the one with steps).\n\nTime and distance: The walk is 7 mile long.\n- First we will do 3.5 miles with the climb up box hill where Elena will then guide us through nice soft stretchy pilates movements. We will chose a spot on top of the hill for the pilates.\n\n- After the climb up box hill and soft stretchy pilates we can chill on top of box hill enjoying lunch, good chats and awesome views (of course). Ideal place to go is the box hill cafe, we can either bring our own picnic or buy something at the cafe.\n\n- After a good rest and lunch we then proceed and walk the remaining 3.5 miles (walking off that lunch and chocolate :) )\n\nTimewise I am expecting the following:\nFirst half: 10/10.30 - 12/12.30\nPilates & Lunch: 12/12.30-13.30/14\nSecond half: 13.30/14-15.30/16.30\n\nElena has advised that it would be best to bring our own pilates mats! (I will be bringing mine in my backpack).\nShe has also advised that not to fret if you don't have a mat as Elena could bring a couple of extra if someone would need.\nFor Elena's expertise if we can leave her a £5 gratuity on the day.\n\nHow to get there:\nBy car would be easiest & potentially Car Sharing too!\nAlternatively the closest train station is at Dorking.\n(this event is jointly run with 20's & 30's ladies in woking so more girls may attend, the more the merrier :) )","dateTime":"2017-07-23T10:00+01:00","duration":"PT6H30M","host":{"id":"101948702","name":"Iris Osk"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":0,"lng":0,"city":" RH5 6SR","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"Ranmore Common Road, Dorking, RHS 6SR"}},{"id":"240763257","title":"Let's bounce - your booty will thank you.","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/240763257","description":"That's right ladies, the Bracknell Trampoline Centre have given in to my persistent stalker emails and we're getting our very own Sunday morning private session!! Then I thought we could shimmy somewhere afterwards for a coffee / bite to eat.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/5/b/600_461907739.jpeg\n\nWhy Bounce?\n\n\"Bouncing Fit\" is 2017's answer to a lean physique, muscle tone and weight loss, all in a low impact way. Oh, and basically having a blast while you're doing it. (My kind of exercise).\n\nThe Bracknell Trampoline Centre was purpose built for trampolining and accommodates everyone from littlies, right up to the Olympic pros. What was previously reserved for gymnasts, schools and back gardens, today, there are approx 120 trampoline parks in the UK! If you're like me, a grownup - nominally at least - and have never released your inner Simone Biles by landing a forward somersault, this meetup is the way forward. Let's get our cardio on and countless calories burned... and then go and have cake... what??\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Y9hB6rkFlyo\n\nHere's a (long) vid of Britain's top two trampolinists, Kat Driscoll and Amanda Parker, giving James O'Brien a crash course (sometimes literally!) in how to trampoline at the Bracknell Trampolining Centre. This isn't really what we'll be doing, but skip to 3.34mins ... AMAZINGGGG!\n\nDo You Actually Get Fit?\n\nRobert Smith of RS Sports Therapy (currently working with Premier League champions Leicester City, so he knows his stuff!) says he's seen: “significant improvement in cardiovascular fitness with regular, 30-minute trampoline workouts. Because the trampoline pad is bouncy and soaks up a large amount of the impact of your landing, your bones and joints are protected and strengthened at the same time.\"\n\nTrampolining is also meant to be much safer on the limbs compared to exercise like running, football, netball, rugby or racket sports. I did read, muscles unused to bouncing it is worth getting warmed up. Looking like you’re taking yourself too seriously is better than risking a strain, pull or tear. I like to look like I take myself seriously, so I have no issues there.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/8/9/600_461907785.jpeg\n\nThe Meetup Deets\nMeet: 10.15am at the centre\nBounce: 10.30 - 11.15\nCoffee: asap post-bounce\n\nThere is space for six for this date (but if there are another six who would also like to join, the centre is happy to put on a separate session starting at 9.30). Bookings as usual on a first paid first reserved basis, so message me if you'd like to book and I'll send over transfer details. For the 45 minute session, all six of us will get our own trampoline - woohoo! And we'll also have a qualified instructor telling us what to do. I don't really care what s/he says, as long as I leave with a toned butt.\n\nWhat To Wear\nSportswear and socks required. No jewellery and long hair must be tied back.\n\nAny questions let me know. Soooo excited about this!

We've relocated to an absolutely gorgeous little restaurant called \"Arthur's\" ten minutes walk from the original venue. It's literally on Twickenham Green - it's bright and sooo cute - a bit of a fave spot of mine actually. Still a good brunch menu (and amaaazing pizza), no bottomless prosecco unfortunately, but they do serve prosecco by the glass / bottle (if anyone fancies sharing). It's about a fifteen minute walk from Twickenham train station - or jump on a bus for five mins. Looking forward to it lovely ladies!\n\nI thought it was time we live up to our namesake with a loooong overdue brunch! There is prosecco on the menu (my fave kind of brunch), with a \"bottomless prosecco\" option available for anyone who's had a particularly gruelling week... which of course I have not yet sampled.

To accompany their chilled out 'lounge' feel, they have an affordable brunch menu with a nice variety (I go for waffles and bacon myself) and great Italian coffee.\n\nTwickenham has excellent public transport links by train and bus, and there’s also quite a bit of parking in nearby residential streets.

But what use is a beautiful new wash bag without some organic treats to fill it?! So Suprina, the Neal's Yard consultant for the evening, is giving away two delicious organic products for each person to take home: an organic facial wash and either their award-winning Wild Rose Beauty Balm or a bottle of luxurious Geranium & Orange Foaming Bath. Throughout the evening, Suprina will be offering one-to-one consultations, helping you find the products that best suit your skin type. She’ll also be bringing along an additional range of beauty products which you can test and purchase on the night.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/0/8/600_465649672.jpeg\n\nDrop in and stay as long as you can or feel free to join for the whole evening. Once the workshop has finished, we’re very welcome to stay on and chat. The Hollywood Arms will be open until 11.30pm so there’s no need to rush off.\n\nCheeky discount! The full price is £25.50, but for The Ladies That Brunch, you can nab a ticket for £19.50 - (which I think is a total steal... pretty sure two NY products on their own would usually cost that!!) You can buy tickets through meetup here, or on eventbrite (although the discount won't be available through eventbrite);\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/an-evening-of-embroidery-organic-beauty-tickets-38653986113\n\nThe price includes everything you need to make your wash bag, plus the opportunity to browse through, and buy at discount, Offset Warehouse fabrics. You’ll receive two Neal’s Yard products as described, a short consultation with Suprina, and the chance to test and buy additional products with additional discounts.\n\nDo you have to be an experienced sewer?\nDefinitely not! The workshop is suitable for adults of all abilities. It’s a great introduction if you’ve never sewn before, and satisfying for more experienced stitchers. The focus will be on the embroidery, and if you only manage to finish that during the evening, the written instructions will enable you to complete your wash bag at home – even if you don’t own a sewing machine.\n\nhttps://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/0/c/600_465649676.jpeg\n\nFormat for the evening\nWhen you arrive at the Hollywood Arms, head upstairs to the Blanchard Room. It’s sumptuously furnished with comfortable chairs and sofas, and you can purchase tea, coffee, soft drinks – or something stronger! – from the bar. Tables will be laid for you to spread out with your embroidery, and Jaime will be on hand to help. Please note that although there won’t be time to include general sewing machine instruction in the evening, the Offset team will be delighted to help. And don’t forget to grab a few minutes with Suprina and take advantage of her extensive beauty knowledge and her expertise in the wonderful Neal’s Yard products.\n\nIt’s well documented that slowing down and learning a new skill – even for a few hours – can reduce stress levels and increase a feeling of wellbeing and satisfaction. I'm sooo excited for this one! Hope to see lots of you there!\n\nIf you have any questions, please get in touch with the Offset Warehouse team: info@offsetwarehouse.com","dateTime":"2017-11-13T18:30Z","duration":"PT3H","host":{"id":"204880130","name":"Charlie Bradley Ross"},"group":{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","urlname":"Ladies-that-Brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too"},"venue":{"lat":51.48608,"lng":-0.184066,"city":"Chelsea SW10 9HX","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"45 Hollywood Road"}},{"id":"245101107","title":"Crafty Fox Market, Dinner & Drinks","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too/events/245101107","description":"Crafty fox is my all-time fave pop up market - and, usually reserved for uber trendy East London venues, it's coming South of the river!

So why don't we head there after work for a little tipple and nibbles, meet the makers and browse the stalls selling a mix of ceramics, art prints and originals, textiles, jewellery and gifts, before we hit the town for some dinner and drinks. Given that we'll arrive in dribs and drabs (depending on where we're coming from after work), we can set up a watsapp group and liaise that way, so you'll be able to find people in the group to walk the market with.\n\nI'll reserve dinner when I get a better idea of numbers - Clapham is a 20min bus from there so think that will be a good shout, but if anyone knows of a nice venue closer then let me know.

The walk follows paths through the parkland and woodland and, whilst these are fairly well made, they can get quite muddy in winter and after periods of rain. There are several climbs and descents throughout. There are no stiles on route but you will need to negotiate several steps and kissing gates. There are a couple of sections of road walking along quiet country lanes so take care of any traffic at these points. The large open grass parkland within Tring Park is used for grazing cattle so take particular care with dogs here. There are public toilets in the car park at the start of the walk.

A senior KGB officer for more than a decade who has supplied the British spymasters with secrets from deep within the Soviet intelligence machine.

You will follow parts of The Ridgeway and Icknield Way paths, well-known for their claims as two of the oldest routes in Britain, with views of the village and the Pitstone Post Mill to enjoy along the way.\n\nThe route follows well-used paths, but the chalk surfaces can be muddy after periods of rain and the tops of the hills are very exposed so make sure you dress appropriately. The route has several moderate climbs and descents. The route crosses several sheep pastures and the Ivinghoe Hills are grazed by free-roaming cattle, ponies and sheep, so take care with dogs. There are no stiles, but you will need to negotiate several kissing gates and pass alongside a cattle grid. Allow 2 hours.\n\nIvinghoe village is located within the Aylesbury Vale district of Buckinghamshire, close to the border with Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. The walk starts and finishes from The King's Head pub, on Station Road. There is roadside parking available by the village green. Approximate post code LU7 9EQ.\n\nThe Curiositea Rooms look ideal for after-walk refreshments. I will check whether we can use their toilets before the walk.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CuriositeaRooms/","dateTime":"2020-07-17T10:30+01:00","duration":"PT2H","host":{"id":"32418202","name":"Martin Jones"},"group":{"id":"33904113","name":"Berkhamsted & Tring Social","urlname":"Berkhamsted-Tring-Social"},"venue":{"lat":51.83627,"lng":-0.629835,"city":"Leighton Buzzard","country":"gb","postalCode":"LU7 9EB","address":"2 Station Road"}},{"id":"271859069","title":"Midweek Walk: Ley Hill, Chess Valley and Latimer","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/berkhamsted-tring-social/events/271859069","description":"This is a spectacular 6.25 mile walk (elevation 566ft.) through meadows and woods.

It was shortlisted for the Booker prize ( 1989) and was also the Sunday Expresses book of the year (1989). Tremain wrote a sequel in 2012 called ‘Merivel: A Man of his Time’. The book is available in all formats: paperback runs at approximately 371 pages. The Restoration of the English monarchy, in the person of Charles II, forms the backdrop of this historical fiction.\n\nAbout the book:\n\nRestoration introduces us to the young Robert Merivel and his rise and fall through glittering seventeenth century society. Merivel goes from triumph to despair as does the restored king himself.\n\nWhen a twist of fate delivers an ambitious young medical student to the court of King Charles II, he is suddenly thrust into a vibrant world of luxury and opulence. Blessed with a quick wit and sparking charm, Robert Merivel rises quickly, soon finding favour with the King, and privileged with a position as ‘paper groom’ to the youngest of the King’s mistresses. However, by falling in love with her, Merivel transgresses the one rule that will cast him out from his new found paradise.\n\nCritical views:\n\n‘For a vivid - and funny - fictional re-creation of the era, Tremain’s Restoration is hard to beat.’ (The Times)\n\n‘A dazzling triumph... it is nothing less than superb.’ (New York Times Book Review)\n\nReading ahead with the Berkworms:\n\n8 September: Psychological Thriller - we are reading ‘The Lost Man’ by Jane Harper, published in 2019 and named a best crime fiction book of 2019 by The Times.\n\n13 October is humour/ comedy.

The White Horse is a delightful pub with a cosy bar, a light and fresh dining room, a leafy garden and a sunny terrace, perfect for refreshments after the walk. The walking route performs a simple loop through the surrounding countryside, taking in the stately Rothamsted Park and House, the Nickey Line former railway, a bluebell wood, quiet arable fields plus a golf course, and enjoying splendid views along the way.\n\nThe route follows a mixture of surfaced paths and unmade paths across grass and fields, the latter of which can be muddy in winter or after periods of rain. There are no stiles or livestock on route. The full circuit includes some steady gradients, four kissing gates and a flight of steps plus three road crossings that need care. It also crosses one paddock that may be holding horses and a golf course (so please watch out for any stray flying balls). The week is 4 miles long and should take no more than 2 hours.\n\nThe full address for the pub is Redbourn Ln, Harpenden AL5 2JP.

Twenty-five year old self-employed gardener, Teresa Green, was recently found slumped over her secateurs in a local garden. The residents of Wendover are completely for'lawn' and the town is teeming with press and police. Could green-fingered Teresa have 'cultivated' an enemy, or un'earth'ed someone's 'dirt'y secrets? Who is the culprit and what did they use? Chief Inspector Cher Locke and her team have drawn up a list of suspects and possible weapons, but need YOUR help in 'pinching out' those not involved in the crime. Best of luck Detectives!\n\nSearching around the crime scene\nYou don’t need a map to solve your treasure trail. The directions will lead you from start to finish. If you miss an answer, simply retrace your steps and try again.\n\nSolving the mystery\nEvery sneaky clue you answer on your trail will be a name or number which matches a potential suspect or weapon in your case. These are shown on the back page of your trail booklet (which you will be given on the day) and, once found, can be eliminated from your investigation. At the end of the trail, you should be left with one suspect and one weapon – case solved!\n\nIf you can’t solve a tricky clue, phone the HQ on 07587867371.

Creating a fake profile on Facebook to cyber-stalk Ludo, Claire poses as Clara, a beautiful 24-year old fashion intern. After liking a couple of posts by Alex (François Civil), Ludo’s handsome friend and assistant, the likes turn into messages, which turn into seductive phone calls, and soon enough a full-blown virtual relationship. Recounting the experience throughout the film to her therapist (Nicole Garcia), Who You Think I Am interrogates the motives behind a predatory poisson-chat (Catfish), as Claire grapples with the insecurities of ageing and her low self-esteem (just ignore the fact that Binoche is a knockout). Insecurity develops into addiction, with Claire becoming obsessed with the thrill her online persona provides her. When Alex insists on meeting her in person, the thriller ramps up with a number of gripping twists and turns, as the line between IRL reality and URL fantasy begins to blur. A film which feels unintentionally timely with its exploration of physical separation and virtual intimacy.\n\nTrailer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShwXIOszzIM\n\nThe cost will include £8 + 50p Paypal charge + 50p booking fee + £1 Meetup contribution = £10\nPlease pay on PayPal and add the reference Who You Think I Am so that the payment can be identified.","dateTime":"2020-09-07T19:30+01:00","duration":"PT2H","host":{"id":"32418202","name":"Martin Jones"},"group":{"id":"33904113","name":"Berkhamsted & Tring Social","urlname":"Berkhamsted-Tring-Social"},"venue":{"lat":51.758614,"lng":-0.560456,"city":"Berkhamsted","country":"gb","postalCode":"HP4 2FG","address":"High Street"}},{"id":"272680169","title":"Berk worms 🐛 BookClub: Psychological Thriller ","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/berkhamsted-tring-social/events/272680169","description":"The Berkworms book club will be reading a Psychological thriller this month.

A natural chalk stream, water companies were attracted to its exceptionally pure water and by the 1990s it was one of the worst affected rivers in the country for abstraction. A new pipeline was built from more sustainable sources and the river was rescued, and this circular walk gives you the opportunity to enjoy a stretch of it, as well as the delights of Old Amersham. It begins in the town, but soon heads up the side of the valley cut by the river to afford great views, although there is a climb involved first to earn them. The river itself is your companion for much of the second half of the walk, and includes a delightful stopping point by a ford, great for picnics or a paddle. At the walk's end there's the opportunity to take in a monument to seven Protestant martyrs burned at the stake in the 16th century, as well as the opportunity to sample part of Old Amersham. Here you can see the King's Arms, which featured as The Lucky Boatman in the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', as well as a number of historical buildings.

If you would like to form your own groups of 3/4, please let me know when you arrive.\n\nPlease take the following precautions if you are planning on attending this event:\n1. Only attend the event if you have no symptoms or reason to believe you have been exposed to the virus\n2. Only attend the event if you, or anyone you are a carer for, are not in the vulnerable category\n3. Greet people without physical contact\n4. Walk at a safe distance from others on the trail at least 1 metre apart.\n\nWe can meet in the Roman Museum (Verulamium) car park although there is a fee to pay. There are other parking options available but an earlier start may give everyone chance to find somewhere in the car park and there are toilets available. The trail is designed to finish back in St. Michael's. We can use the Six Bells pub afterwards but I need to give further details later. There is a limit on numbers due to the restricted space in the pub.\n\nThere's treasure ahoy!\n\nEvil archaeologist Shuvlyn Pick discovers a priceless Roman artifact whilst digging in the city park, which by rights belongs to the citizens. He buries the relic at a secret location, intending to dig it up later to sell to a private dealer for vast sums of money. But wait....you find a map with a series of locations marked on it. All you have to do now is discover the right location, and return the treasure to the citizens. Let the hunt begin!\n\nSearching around the crime scene\nYou don’t need a map to solve your treasure trail. The directions will lead you from start to finish. If you miss an answer, simply retrace your steps and try again.\n\nSolving the mystery\nEvery sneaky clue you answer on your trail will be a name which matches a location on your hidden treasure map. This is shown on the back page of your trail booklet (which you will be given on the day) and, once found, can be eliminated from your search. At the end of the trail, you should be left with one location – treasure discovered!\n\nIf you can’t solve a tricky clue, phone 07587867371. The line will go directly to an eminent archaeologist who will only allow you to contact him three times – he is a very busy man!\n\nPlease note that there is a small £1 charge to cover costs.","dateTime":"2020-09-27T10:00+01:00","duration":"PT2H","host":{"id":"32418202","name":"Martin Jones"},"group":{"id":"33904113","name":"Berkhamsted & Tring Social","urlname":"Berkhamsted-Tring-Social"},"venue":{"lat":51.75374,"lng":-0.354001,"city":"St. Albans","country":"gb","postalCode":"","address":"St Michael's St"}},{"id":"273011553","title":"Berkocinegoers at The Rex: Leon","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/berkhamsted-tring-social/events/273011553","description":"As a part of its social distancing policy, The Rex asks that visitors wear masks in the bar/foyer area but can remove these on entering the auditorium.

In this his English language debut, Jean Reno plays Leon, the coolest assassin ever, with fantastic new (then) child-star: Natalie Portman as Mathilda.\nAt only 12-years-old, Mathilda returns one day from running an errand to find her dysfunctional, family wiped out after a corrupt undercover police raid, led by psychotic cop, Stansfield (a terrifying, Gary Oldman). As luck would have it, it turns out she lives next door to a very quiet assassin: Leon. Reluctantly he takes her in. Let the story begin.\nThe film has everything it needs to be an action thriller in every detail, high on emotion. Outstanding performances, mind-blowing action, loads of tension and violence, on top of which is a truly amazing screenplay.\n“Having one career highlight performance in a film is a treat. Having three is just spoiling us” (Total Film)\n“Reno's performance of hangdog loyalty lends his character pleasing sympathy, while Besson's heavily stylized direction builds tension around sexy violence.” (Film4) What a tepid writing for a film so hot.\nThe three performances are shining-brilliant from the start. One of the most thorough thrillers from the last 25 years.\n\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNw0D7Hh0DY&list=PLT5O5U1wCp-Mjyafe25yKwoIftsptitXO&index=144\n\nThe cost will include £8 + 50p Paypal charge + 50p booking fee + £1 Meetup contribution = £10\n\nPayment should be paid by Paypal with the reference LEON","dateTime":"2020-09-29T19:15+01:00","duration":"PT2H","host":{"id":"32418202","name":"Martin Jones"},"group":{"id":"33904113","name":"Berkhamsted & Tring Social","urlname":"Berkhamsted-Tring-Social"},"venue":{"lat":51.758614,"lng":-0.560456,"city":"Berkhamsted","country":"gb","postalCode":"HP4 2FG","address":"High Street"}},{"id":"273507284","title":"Friday Walk: Wigginton and the Grand Union Canal","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/berkhamsted-tring-social/events/273507284","description":"Please read all of the instructions.\n\nThis walk will go ahead with the recent advice by the government regarding groups that up to 6 people from different households are allowed to meet outdoors.

We have selected the comical story, ‘Joy in the Morning’ Written by the widely read humorist P. G. Wodehouse, written in 1946 and set in the 1930’s. This book is available in all formats and runs at approximately 320 pages. The kindle edition is £3.99\n\nAbout the book:\n\nThis is part of the Jeeves & Worcester series written by Wodehouse. It is preceded by ‘The code of the Woosters’. This story is another adventure of Bertie Wooster and his resourceful valet Jeeves.\n\nTrapped in rural Steeple Bumpleigh, a man less stalwart than Bertie Wooster would probably give way at the knees.\n\nFor among those present were Florence Craye, to whom Bertie had once been engaged and her new fiancé 'Stilton' Cheesewright, who sees Bertie as a snake in the grass. And that biggest blot on the landscape, Edwin the Boy Scout, who is busy doing acts of kindness out of sheer malevolence. All Bertie's forebodings are fully justified. For in his efforts to oil the wheels of commerce, promote the course of true love and avoid the consequences of a vendetta, he becomes of a vendetta, he becomes the prey of all and sundry. In fact only Jeeves can save him...\n\nCritical views:\n\n‘It's dangerous to use the word genius to describe a writer, but I'll risk it with him ‘-- John Humphrys\n\n‘For as long as I'm immersed in a P.G. Wodehouse book, it's possible to keep the real world at bay and live in a far, far nicer, funnier one where happy endings are the order of the day ‘-- Marian Keyes\n\n‘Wodehouse always lifts your spirits, no matter how high they happen to be already’-- Lynne Truss\n\n‘The incomparable and timeless genius - perfect for readers of all ages, shapes and sizes! ‘-- Kate Mosse\n\n‘Not only the funniest English novelist who ever wrote but one of our finest stylists’ -- Susan Hill\n\nReading ahead with the Berkworms:\n\n10 November: World literature - Ten Minutes, 38 Seconds in this Strange World by Elif Shafak.\n\nHappy reading, Cazza","dateTime":"2020-10-13T20:00+01:00","duration":"PT1H30M","host":{"id":"133968342","name":"Cazza"},"group":{"id":"33904113","name":"Berkhamsted & Tring Social","urlname":"Berkhamsted-Tring-Social"},"venue":{"lat":-8.521147,"lng":179.1962,"city":"","country":"","postalCode":"","address":""}},{"id":"273735966","title":"Wednesday afternoon walk.

She elevates this tragic tale of one huge, tiny life. This little girl’s magnetism and instant presence lifts the whole film into something above all. From the slums of Paris to the limelight of New York, Piaf’s life was a constant battle to sing and survive, to live and love. ‘Little Sparrow’ flew so high it was inevitable she would burn her wings in bravado, brilliance and self-destruction. “Marion Cotillard expertly impersonates* the legendary singer whose passionate vibrato, like a demented car-alarm, electrified the nation….a great performance” (PB Guardian) * No. She takes it on and rings its heart’s bell soft and clear.\n\nForget critics (always).

Each of these settlements has buildings of historic interest. Great Gaddesden has the fine 12th Century Church of St John the Baptist, a 15th Century cruck barn, recently restored, and early 17th Century cottages. Gaddesden Place was built by the architect James Wyatt in 1768 for the Halsey family, who have lived in the parish since the 1300’s. The bridge over the Gade at Water End was built in the 19th Century and is particularly attractive. It has pointed arches, giving a medieval appearance. St Margaret’s takes its name from the site of an ancient Nunnery and now houses the Amavarati Buddhist Temple. We can take a few minutes to visit the monastery and the church if time allows.\nThe walk takes us through fields, hills and woods with a short leg along a busy road where we need to take care. There are some steady uphill climbs through ploughed fields which may be heavy going in wet weather. The walk is approximately 4 miles and should take no longer than 2 hours.\nThere is plenty of parking available at the Garden Centre and we can enjoy some food and drink after the walk. Dogs are allowed in the Garden Centre.\nGreat Gaddesden is situated 2 miles north west of Hemel Hempstead on the A4146 Leighton Buzzard Road.

There is some parking space in front of the Greyhound pub and around the pond but a better option is in the car park further along Stocks Road. We walk uphill through the Stocks golf club and into the woods to pick up the Ridgeway. The walk takes us past Aldbury Nowers which is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) managed by the Hertfordshire and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. The site, formerly known as \"Duchie's Piece,\" comprises two areas of hillside, linked by The Ridgeway. The calcareous meadow element of the site hosts the flowers of chalk grassland and has butterfly habitats with thirty-four different species of butterfly recently recorded, including the Duke of Burgundy, hairstreaks and the Essex skipper. The site also includes a \"beech hanger\", a type of upland ancient woodland, and is considered one of the best examples of this feature in Hertfordshire. We continue across open countryside towards Ivinghoe Beacon but cut back to walk uphill towards the Ashridge estate woodland. At the Bridgewater Monument we head downhill to return to Aldbury.\n\nThe walk should take less than 2.5 hours and once we return to Aldbury, there is the option to take refreshments in the Greyhound where there is a spacious beer garden.\n\nThe address for the pub is The Greyhound, Stocks Road, Aldbury, Nr Tring.

This book is available in all formats and runs at approximately 320 pages. The kindle edition is £4.99.

Each fading memory brings back the friends she made in her bittersweet life - friends who are now desperately trying to find her . . .\n\nCritical views:\n\n“A rich sensual novel...” Francesca Segal, Financial Times\n\n“Expect vibrant, vivid and eye-opening descriptions of Middle Eastern life propelled by a tender storyline, all in Shafak's haunting, beautiful and considered prose” Vanity Fair\n\n“Simply magnificent, a truly captivating work of immense power and beauty, on the essence of life and its end” Philippe Sands\n\n'A vivid carnival of life and death, cruelty and kindness, love, politics and deep humanity.

With a budget of $200 million, it sits right in the top bracket of the most expensive streaming productions ever made. And it shows, globetrotting through a series of incredible locations ranging from Prague to the Château de Chantilly in France. It’s a streamlined story with plenty of explosive action, all stemming from a battle of wills between its two central forces. Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans are on typically fine form here, providing a real mano a mano and representing two distinctly different versions of the CIA; in what it can be, and what it can do.\nGenuine, hard-hitting entertainment.\n\nTrailer:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmllggGO4pM\n\nParking in Berkhamsted is very difficult but there is road parking along Three Close Lane.
