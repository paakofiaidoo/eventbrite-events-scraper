According to George Miller — master purveyor of carmaggedon turned pioneer of talking pig movies — this is the extent of what you can expect to find after nuclear war has reduced society to rubble. These are also the magnificent contents of a sequel that betters its predecessor (the shoestring stuntfest/personal revenge movie that was Mad Max) addressing the post-apocalyptic scenario with a punk rock sensibility and creating a grungy future chic and which propeled Mel Gibson to superstardom. And there was, of course, a further sequel, the inferior but interesting Beyond Thunderdome which made the mistake of diluting Max's darkness (concentrating on his journey back to himself).</p> <p>Obsessed with his furious highspeed demolition derby, Miller structures a very linear plot in Mad Max 2 — you could happily describe it as one long chase scene (but there is a little more than that). Since the events that turned Max Roxatansky, well, mad there has been a total global apocalypse leaving the world stark and empty and startling like the desert badlands of New South Wales. Here a bad gang (led by the towering, bemasked Lord Houmungus (Nilsson) besieges a good gang, led by the idealistic naivete of Papagallo (Michael Preston) who have an oil refinery and therefore the new gold: petrol.</p> <p>TRAILER<br/><a href=\"https://youtu.be/UlwtiOyaoo0\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/UlwtiOyaoo0</a></p> <p>CINEMA TICKETS<br/>£14 regular or £11 for PCC members.<br/>Book here for 4.35pm screening: <a href=\"https://princecharlescinema.com/PrinceCharlesCinema.dll/Booking?Booking=TSelectItems.waSelectItemsPrompt.TcsWebMenuItem_0.TcsWebTab_0.TcsPerformance_23565641.TcsSection_18488279\" class=\"linkified\">https://princecharlescinema.com/PrinceCharlesCinema.dll/Booking?Booking=TSelectItems.waSelectItemsPrompt.TcsWebMenuItem_0.TcsWebTab_0.TcsPerformance_23565641.TcsSection_18488279</a></p> <p>DRINKS<br/>We can go for a drink before the movie.</p> <p>SCHEDULE<br/>3.00pm - drinks<br/>Film starts at 4:35pm</p> <p>ADDRESSES<br/>Prince Charles Cinema 7 Leicester Pl, London WC2H 7BY<br/>Read less</p> ",

I’m gonna give you the best seat in the house!” – Ashley</p> <p>As much as I enjoyed *Malibu Express*, I assumed all the other movies in Andy Sidaris’ *Triple B Series* would taper off in quality. Well, I’m glad to say that this one is slightly better than its predecessor.</p> <p>I think a lot of that has to do with this one embracing its comedic elements even more and being pretty over-the-top with the more bonkers shit.</p> <p>It also helps that this film features Harold Diamond, who was always enjoyable in the movies he did with a similar cult action director, Amir Shervan.</p> <p>While you could write this off as more of the same, I liked the buddy-action approach, as well as dumping in more Playboy Playmates and sexiness.</p> <p>That being said, this did look a bit cheaper than the film before it. That doesn’t necessarily make it worse in that regard, it just made it so that the special effects people had to get more creative and they certainly did and succeeded. But you also have to suspend disbelief when the one dude is using a bazooka pretty recklessly but that just makes this picture more fun and absurd, in a great way.</p> <p>This is absolutely a cheesy action movie but it’s also supposed to be. It felt like Sidaris was self-aware after making just one film and he took advantage of that, giving us a flick that didn’t try to pretend it was something better than it was. It knew its limitations but turned them into amusing strengths.

What is it that makes them stand out and unique? Does the song have personal relevance to you? Are the lyrics poetic or a philosophical masterpiece like in some old hip-hop or is it about the sound of the vocals or hypnotic melodies? Did the song (or artist) play a pivotal role in shaping political change &amp; influence in society (yes some musicians even died for their artform) or the evolution of new music genres, sub cultures and underground music movements today? Was Lennon &amp; McCartney the greatest ever singer song writer combo or have you heard better? Who are the best all time music producers &amp; song writers - Max Martin, Billy Joel, George Martin, Quincy Jones, Bernie Taupin, Dr Dre, Carole King? Did PWL records destroy British music or contribute to it?</p> <p>We can also touch on influential music producers, labels, DJs and radio stations as well. Discussion on all elements of musicology and enablers is up for grabs!</p> <p>If you can - come prepared with links to samples (feel free to post youtube and other links in the comments section below) to demonstrate or be willing to sing/rap some lyrics so we can get an idea. Funky dance moves optional.</p> <p>The event will only go ahead if we have at least 8 people confirmed For drinks I have a limited spaces for 15 so please confirm if you will be joining or not - this will be on first confirmed first come basis.</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================<br/>We will meet outside Camden Town Station (Camden High Street exist) and go to my favourite pub in Camden - the very unique Elephants Head with a brillant vibe, very friendly people from all around the world (look out for Johnny Depp, Gaddafi &amp; John Lennon) and music spanning decades from the 50s to contemporary and every style. We iwll be in there all night from the designated start time.

The only differentiated coffee event with mind numbing boring small talk left at home &amp; with Chillout's resident Guru Swami offering free insightful thought provoking readings - just for a bit of fun of course!</p> <p>If you're intellectually curious, open minded and inquisitive about life's big questions and potential links to noetic sciences &amp; consciousness then is defo for you. We'll try to touch on the empirical literature/evidence for paranormal phenomena &amp; potential explanations including ( I can share research studies with you) :</p> <p>\\- Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?</p> <p>\\- Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" \\(quantum entanglement\\) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?</p> <p>\\- What existed before the universe \\(big bang\\) \\- how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play and suggest about unknown dimensions and out understanding of entwined space and time?</p> <p>\"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking once said. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?</p> <p>\\- Is the near death experieince phenomena millions have experienced a result of neurochemical and hormonal changes that occur in the body &amp; brain close to death \\(esp\\. in truma conditions\\) or something beyond physicality?</p> <p>\\- Given neuroscience research is in it's infancy relative to other areas of medicine/science and so there is yet still so little understanding of the brain\\, could mediation help to access additional functions that are not available when we are operate in BAU alpha\\, beta and gamma brainwaves phases?</p> <p>\\- As well as the brain \\- studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons\\. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in Last Christmas?</p> <p>The smartest philsoophers and scientists know we will never know the real truth but can we employ any experimental and other practical empirical techniques to get there? An approach guided by Immanuel Kant's pragamatism &amp; Aristotle's deductive reasoning seems the most optimal epistemology here but is there any other methodologies?</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================<br/>We'll meet inside The Zodiac Bar in Camden. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group. I'll be wearing a Starwars identifier and also share table location on the day.</p> <p>The event is subject to securing at least 10 confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend.

Fiirst we'll meet for 90 mins for fun rounders followed by chilled chat, drinks and food in a nearby pretty spot in the park that I'll escort everyone to.</p> <p>**Part 1 - Rounders**<br/>Rounders is a famous social group sport we (brits) grew up playing at school. Conceptionaly &amp; practically it's very similar to American Baseball &amp; Softball. It's such an enjoyable and fun to play sport that even our unifit teachers took part! So why not get into the summer vibe &amp; competitive spirit by joining for some fun, whist gettin in some healthy exercise too!</p> <p>Beginners welcome as there will be a practice run before the main match and the rules explained clearly to all beginners (don't worry, it's not rocket science!). You don't need to be an athlete or a seasoned sport's professional - you just need to be healthy/fit enough to run around intermittently (the faster the better!). If you are good at catching and hitting that's a mega bonus!</p> <p>**Part 2 - Post Rounders from 3.45 Onwards**<br/>For the second part of the aftertoon we will walk to the nearby non games spot in Regent's Park after the rounders finishes at around just after 3.40, or if you prefer and there are free places - you can stay behind and play mixed football with the sports group! If you are only joining for this second part then you must meet me between 3.30 and 3.45 in the rounders area location indicated on the map as I can't share multiple locations on here. I will be in the large group standing and there will be groups playing football next to us.</p> <p>This event is being run in conjuction other groups so RSVPs/turnout is higher than the actual RSVPs you see here. The first colloboration is with Yau's sports group and then Calvin's generic socials group later</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

Yes apart from me - there'll be no grandads doing the shuffle in here!</p> <p>Because we love our music - here at Chillout you only get the real deal. Experienced DJs with extensive muisc knowledge and who really know their stuff outside of contemporary pop music scene is very elusive to find. Thankfully this venue's DJ has a wide collection and knows his 80s stuff despite being under the age of 30 - keeping it real all night and taking special music requests as well. **This is not a generic event but a social for people that are passionate about the music, please don't deprive a genuine music lover a place!!!**</p> <p>If you think those touristy trashy commercial central london places that put on 80s night aimed at generic revellers are any good think again. Many real music fans have complained because less than 20% of tracks played are from the 80s! Sure as a pirate radio &amp; club DJ myself, you mix in some current tunes &amp; remixes to keep things engaging n fresh but this mash up should constitute no more than 5% of what you play on the night.</p> <p>So unless you want to spend your time in a meat market and want to avoid grave musical disappointment- here's places advertised as retro that best to skip on Sat night:<br/>\\- Tattershall Castle 80s Night: Fake\\. 10% 80s at best with dance disabled 30 year olds \\(i\\.e\\. 2 left feet\\) exhibiting teenage let's get pissed and snog some random on the dance floor mentality\\.<br/>\\- Loop Bar \\- 80s Night: Fake \\- Better than Tatters but no less trashy \\- filled with tourists &amp; students\\. Was better pre\\-covid when they had well known experienced former London radio DJs spinning the right tunes<br/>\\- Reflex club \\- Was the real macoy before recent rebrand into popworld\\. Now it's just rowdy plain lame with very little 80s<br/>-Maggie's (Thatcher). Can't fault the music but poncy. Unless you've got a bigger bank account than Rishi Sunnak and you're quintessentially english with a posh accent to boot you'll probably wont get in</p> <p>So If you know of any venues that don't blatantly violate the Trades Descriptions Act &amp; successfully put on the following nights - message me and we can do some events devoted to music we genuinely love: 50s/Rock N Roll, Hip-Hop (American), 60s, reggae nights, 70s, acid house, 90s, balearic beat/electro, 00s &amp; soul/blues nights.</p> <p>This is a joint event with another group so actual RSVPs are higher than what you see here.</p> <p>Lucas - Legendary 80s Hip Hop Grandad</p> ",

But let's not forget this will be a social so we'll have some much needed fun as well!</p> <p>It will be run in conjunction with my investing strategies group so total RSVPs is higher than what you see here.

Central banks tightening and implications for global asset prices (stocks, currencies, crypto, commodities, bond yields, property) and outlook for inflation &amp; economic growth.<br/>2. Current valuations, risk of market crash and prolonged bear market for the major indices. The biggest \"everything bubble\" since 2000 finally began to unwind Q4 2021 with Nasdax down -30% &amp; some tech stocks down -90%. How more low could we go? A lot lower than people think.<br/>3. My proprietary indicators are forecating a global slowdown in earnings so I see fair value for stocks at much lower mutiples (PE) fulled partly by higher business costs whilst ponzinomics cryptos intrinsic value worth close to zero though - given high volatility - ok for short term trade but watch out below. Japan is now even more fucked with their failed 30 year QE experiment delivering a 50 year low valueless Yen. Is a FX mean reversion trade worth a punt? With the Euro near dollar parity is the failed EU project likely to follow suit soon?<br/>4. Geo political events including but not limited to Russian invasion, financial sanctions and spillovers to global markets and economies.<br/>5. As a US presidential candidate on the campaign trail once mocked the incumbent: \"it's the economy - stupid\". My leading indicators predicting major contraction if not outright global recession. Apart from the Bank of England, are the ECB/Fed in denial? The 3000+ Phd economists can't all be useless or maybe it's just Jay? Never get a lawyer whose decisions negatively effect billions globally to do a real man's job (what was congress/ president thinking appointing him and for that matter Yellen &amp; Bernanke who have never worked in the real world either).<br/>6. Market Sentiment &amp; Earnings. Spurred by their recency bias, it seems many who never invested in a pre GFC regime have been buying the dips. Beware of the high correlation between growth slowdown &amp; lower company earnings / misses (minus share buybacks). Yes sentiment/investor pyschology can matter short term but profitability ultimately drive prices, even extreme oversold signals on technicals can lose predictive value depending on market regime &amp; levels of risk aversion.<br/>7. Depth of policy tightening &amp; credibility reassertion. Economists pricing in rates to 3.5% along with QT. If inflation persists will a deep global recession be the price we have to pay? Many expect Fed pivot but with inflation forecasts nowhere near target &amp; unemployment well below level considered consisitent with price stability (NAIRU), why would they? This is not 2012 nor 2018 - the only thing that has pivoted is the economic paradigm with nearest parallels - UK/US/Europe in 70s/80s. Asset price mandate doesn't exist, the best empirical evidence shows long term growth suffers and the poor get even poorer. Don't Fight the Fed<br/>8. UK interest rate rises / monetary policy tightening and implications for house prices &amp; economy. Looks like we're heading into recession soon (or already in one). BOE's governer blaming everything from Ukraine to sunspot activity at the annoyance of the MPC hawks!<br/>9. Risks from new Covid variants and macro impact. What's going on with China lockdown of cities like Shanghai? Something not right - ulterior motives to cripple global economy &amp; further add to supply constraints to aid Putin's war? Who knows - as Philosopher Socrates once graciously said \"I know nothin\".

No doubt we'll hear the usual jokes I've heard hundreds of times before!</p> <p>Alcoholic beverage (wine, beer, cider only), hot drinks and food/snacks will be available to purchase at the observation point/warm indoor cafe with seating area and outside (glass) view of the park.<br/>I will also have people coming from my outdoor adventures group plus some from Calvin's so total RSVPs are higher than what you see here for this reason!</p> <p>====ITINERARY=====<br/>Meet outside Camden Tube Station at 7.00 PM. After a short wait for anyone delayed, I will escort everyone to the observation point in Regent's Park and brief everyone in terms what to expect and instructions for interacting with any Telescopes. The walk will take 15-20 mins max. Around 10.45 or earlier if the weather turns sour, we will leave and I will walk the group back to Camden. Alternatively people can also take a bus or walk from the observation point to Baker Street. Sometimes a few of us go for a drink in Camden afterwards. I will send out my contact number to people who have reserved for the event in case you have of any issues finding us.<br/>===What Can You Expect To See (this time of year)? =====</p> <p>* Orion Nebula<br/>* Jupiter and 4 moons<br/>* Star clusters such as The Owl Cluster, pleiades etc<br/>* International Space station fly by<br/>* Saturn &amp; rings<br/>* Venus &amp; Mercury<br/>* Andromedia Galaxy<br/>* Binary &amp; tripple star systems (think planet *Tatooine in* Starwars!),<br/>* Neptune<br/>* Uranuus<br/>* Mars<br/>* Our moon</p> <p>More here from Jodrell Bank Observatory/Astrophysics Centre:<br/>[<a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/</a>)<br/>Guide to viewing the cosmos for beginners:<br/>[<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp\" class=\"linkified\">https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp](https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp</a>)<br/>===Weather=====<br/>The event is subject to clear skies on the night so if on the actual day of the event the weather conditions are confirmed unsuitable beyond doubt then I may cancel or postpone.

Fiirst we'll meet for 90 mins for fun rounders followed by chilled chat, drinks and food in a nearby pretty spot in the park that I'll escort everyone to.</p> <p>**Part 1 - Rounders**<br/>Rounders is a famous social group sport we (brits) grew up playing at school. Conceptionaly &amp; practically it's very similar to American Baseball &amp; Softball. It's such an enjoyable and fun to play sport that even our unifit teachers took part! So why not get into the summer vibe &amp; competitive spirit by joining for some fun, whist gettin in some healthy exercise too!</p> <p>Beginners welcome as there will be a practice run before the main match and the rules explained clearly to all beginners (don't worry, it's not rocket science!). You don't need to be an athlete or a seasoned sport's professional - you just need to be healthy/fit enough to run around intermittently (the faster the better!). If you are good at catching and hitting that's a mega bonus!</p> <p>**Part 2 - Post Rounders from 3.44 Onwards**<br/>For the second part of the aftertoon we will walk to the nearby non games spot in Regent's Park after the rounders finishes at around just after 3.40, or if you prefer and there are free places - you can stay behind and play mixed football with the sports group! If you are only joining for this second part then you must meet me between 3.30 and 3.45 in the rounders area location indicated on the map as I can't share multiple locations on here. I will be in the large group standing and there will be groups playing football next to us.</p> <p>This event is being run in conjuction other groups so RSVPs/turnout is higher than the actual RSVPs you see here. The first colloboration is with Yau's sports group and then Calvin's generic socials group later</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

People with science backgrounds are definitely welcome. We'll also try to touch on the empirical literature/evidence for paranormal phenomena &amp; potential explanations including ( I can share research studies with you) :</p> <p>\\- Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?</p> <p>\\- Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" \\(quantum entanglement\\) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?</p> <p>\\- What existed before the universe \\- how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play and suggest about unknown dimensions and out understanding of entwined space and time?</p> <p>\"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking once said. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?</p> <p>\\- Is the near death experieince phenomena millions have experienced a result of neurochemical and hormonal changes that occur in the body &amp; brain close to death \\(esp\\. in truma conditions\\) or something beyond physicality?</p> <p>\\- Given neuroscience research is in it's infancy relative to other areas of medicine/science and so there is yet still so little understanding of the brain\\, could mediation help to access additional functions that are not available when we are operate in BAU alpha\\, beta and gamma brainwaves phases?</p> <p>\\- As well as the brain \\- studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons\\. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in Last Christmas?</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================<br/>We'll meet inside The Zodiac Bar in Camden. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group. I'll be wearing a Starwars identifier and also share table location on the day.</p> <p>The event is subject to securing at least 10 confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend. In the case of a waiting list - priority will be given to people than can demonstrate a genuine interest in the broader subject area, acquaintances and most loyal members.</p> <p>Remember our jingo - great stimulating but fun interesting meetups for a great city for free with Chillout London.</p> <p>Guru Swami Lucas</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Rounders is a famous british social group sport we (brits) grew up playing at school. Conceptionaly and practically it's very similar to American Baseball &amp; Softball. For many it was the only PE class that everyone really enjoyed because it is so much fun to play and teachers always took part! So why not get into the summer sports mood by joining for some fun and running around to get in some healthy exercise as well!</p> <p>We'll play rounders between 2 and 3.30 and then after we've worked up an appetite and thirst - a few of us may optionally go to pub/resturant/cafe in Regent's Park for drinks/food/coffee. Or if you prefer you can stay behind and play mixed football in the next event!</p> <p>Beginners welcome but please ensure you are there at the start so we can run through the rules &amp; scoring system and you get to participate in practice run before the main match.</p> <p>All equipment will be provided so just need to bring yourself. You don't need to be an athlete or a seasoned sports players - just ensure you are healthy overall with a basic level of fitness to be able to run around intermittently. If you are good at catching and hitting stuff that is a big bonus!</p> <p>This event is being run in conjuction with another group so RSVPs/ turnout is higher than the actual RSVPs you see here.</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

After the band finishes around 11, we'll drop some funky moves &amp; singalong to some europhoric tunes spun by a verstile DJ who'll mash up multi decade eclectic tunes verse by verse until 2.30AM - it's gonna be jam hot!!</p> <p>Of course you don't actually need to get up on stage and sing - as long as you love music - you are welcome to sing, cheer and dance along with the vibrant crowd. Oh and I know it's Jubilee weekend but probably best not to sing God Save The Queen, at least not the Sex Pistols version!</p> <p>\\#\\#\\#\\# For The Musicians/Singers \\#\\#\\#\\#<br/>If you've never sung live with a real band on stage before then make sure you know your chosen song and lyrical placement/timing inside out as this is NOT Karoake or a studio jamming practice session!</p> <p>You don't necessarily need vocals like Mariah but you should at least be able to carry a tune or the band will think you're takin the piss! Usually we have two highly experienced guitarists, a drummer and two backing vocalists. Note that song options are likely to be confined to mainstream soul/blues, pop, rock &amp; RnB genres spanning mutiple music decades from contemporary to classics so there should be a song for everyone (as long as you don't steal one of mine!).</p> <p>This is a join event with another group so the number of RSVPs will be higher than what you see here. So limiting RSVPs because the place will be very busy and there will be limited slots for songs. The venue will be: Radicals &amp; Victuallers, 59 Upper St, London N1 0NY</p> <p>Lucas The Entertainer</p> ",

Please register at following link if you want stay updated on relevent future events and see the other RSVPs: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/investing-trading-macroeconomics-financial-markets/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/investing-trading-macroeconomics-financial-markets/</a></p> <p>**Some potential market impacting themes &amp; latest hot global political &amp; economic developments to ponder:**</p> <p>1. Central banks tightening and implications for global asset prices (stocks, currencies, crypto, commodities, bond yields, property) and outllook for inflation &amp; economic growth.<br/>2. Current valuations and risk of market crash and prolonged bear market for the major indices. The biggest \"everything bubble\" since 2000 finally began to unwind Q4 2021 with Nasdax down -30% &amp; some junk tech stocks down -90%. How more low could we go?<br/>3. My proprietary global indicators is a forecating major global slowdown in earnings so I see fair value for stocks at much lower mutiples (PE) whilst Ponzi scheme cryptos worth close to zero from a fundamentals/intrinsic valuation perspective though - given high volatility - ok for short term trading. Japan is now even more fucked with 50 year low Yen getting close to worthless or is it worth an FX mean reversion trade? Will the Euro soon follow suit?<br/>4. Geo political events including but not limited to Russian invasion, financial sanctions and spillovers to global markets and economies.<br/>5. As a presidential candidate once said - it's the economy stupid. We've already had a negative Q1 print for US GDP though consumer component held up strong. Nevertheless, many macro leading indicators I track predicting major contraction if not outright global recession in months ahead. Apart from the Bank of England - are the ECB and Fed in denial? The 3000+ Phd economists there can't all be stupid or maybe it's just Jay Powell? Never get a lawyer to do a real man's job (what was congress &amp; the president thinking eh????), though neither Yellen or Bernanke ever worked in the real world, shouldn't of been appointed either).<br/>6. Market Sentiment &amp; Earnings. Seems many investors out there suffering recency bias who have never invested in a pre GFC regime still buying the dips! Beware - esp. given the correlation between growth slowdown already underway &amp; lower company earnings / misses (not withstanding stock buybacks). Yes sentiment/ investor pyschology can matter but earnings/profitability ultimately drive stocks, even extreme oversold signals on technicals can lose predictive value depending on market regime.<br/>7. Depth of policy tightening &amp; credibility. Many economists pricing in 6-8 rate hikes along with quantitative tightening. If inflation persists above target how far will they go before they crash markets depper, force a global recession &amp; soaring unemployment? Because they are so behind the curve - probably will be the price we have to pay to get living costs back under control. Yes many expect the Fed to pivot before then but with inflation forecasts nowhere near target and unemployment well below the level the Fed considers consisitent with stable low inflation (their NAIRU estimate), why would they? This is not 2012 or 2018 - we're in a macroeconomic environment that last existed over 40 years ago (nearest parallel - UK/America/Europe in 70s/80s). The only thing that has pivoted is the economic paradigm!<br/>8. UK interest rate rises / monetary policy tightening and implications for house prices &amp; economy. Looks like we are going into recession soon (or might already be in one) but don't worry the rest of the world will soon follow.<br/>9. Risks from new Covid variants and econmoic impact. What's going on with China locking down of major cities like Shanghai? Something does not sound right - ulterior motives to cripple global economy &amp; or further adding to supply side inflation and maybe aid Putin's war on mutiple fronts?

Feel free to bring whatever active social hobby you want to share your passion others with. There is a cafe just 5 mins walk away (Serpentine Bar &amp; Kitchen) where you can refuel on drinks, food and snacks. Unless it rains this event will go ahead even with cloudy skies - with the right fun shining personalities around - it can always be sunny!</p> <p>This is a joint event with Calvin from his group so total RSVPs are higher than what you see here.</p> <p>**Timings &amp; Intros**<br/>Arrive anytime from between 3.30 to 5 for optimal integration whilst people are still fresh and have not formed inevitable cliques. If you're new to scene don't worry the organisers will be there to welcome and introduce you to other attendees. For easy identification I'll be wearing a starwars lanyard.

The only differentiated coffee event with mind numbing boring small talk left at home &amp; with Chillout's resident Guru Swami offering free insightful thought provoking readings - just for a bit of fun of course!</p> <p>If you're intellectually curious, open minded and inquisitive about life's big questions and potential links to noetic sciences &amp; consciousness then is defo for you. People with science backgrounds are definitely welcome. We'll also try to touch on the empirical literature/evidence for paranormal phenomena &amp; potential explanations including ( I can share research studies with you) :</p> <p>\\- Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?</p> <p>\\- Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" \\(quantum entanglement\\) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?</p> <p>\\- What existed before the universe \\- how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play and suggest about unknown dimensions and out understanding of entwined space and time?</p> <p>\"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking once said. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?</p> <p>\\- Is the near death experieince phenomena millions have experienced a result of neurochemical and hormonal changes that occur in the body &amp; brain close to death \\(esp\\. in truma conditions\\) or something beyond physicality?</p> <p>\\- Given neuroscience research is in it's infancy relative to other areas of medicine/science and so there is yet still so little understanding of the brain\\, could mediation help to access additional functions that are not available when we are operate in BAU alpha\\, beta and gamma brainwaves phases?</p> <p>\\- As well as the brain \\- studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons\\. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in Last Christmas?</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================<br/>We'll meet inside The Zodiac Bar in Camden. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group. I'll be wearing a Starwars identifier and also share table location on the day.</p> <p>The event is subject to securing at least 10 confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend. In the case of a waiting list - priority will be given to people than can demonstrate a genuine interest in the broader subject area, acquaintances and most loyal members.</p> <p>Remember our jingo - great stimulating but fun interesting meetups for a great city for free with Chillout London.</p> <p>Guru Swami Lucas</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Namesta! Here at Chillout we love trying new things, exploring and experiencing other cultures and tonight is no exception. If you love international music &amp; flavoursome cusine then join for authentic Indian supper followed by a complimentary fun Bollywood music party/club after party and dancing with DJ in the heart of trendy Camden.</p> <p>As well as traditional much loved classic dishes the restaurant also serves in street-food style sharing plates, paying homage to different regions in India and their trademark street food charms.</p> <p>\\*\\*\\*\\*After Party &amp; Clubbing from 9.45PM<br/>But if you're not into dining/Indian food then you can still join for part 2 of the evening - an euphoric after party from 9.45 onwards in the same venue though you will be charged £10-15 at the door for entry to the club night like all the other punters - a venue specfic charge, nothing to do with Chillout. The music will be a mix of mostly retro and contemporary up-tempo Hindi Bollywood music. Average age in venue is normally between 20 to 40.</p> <p>\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*IMPORTANT<br/>Unfortunately no plus ones for the dinner (unless you want to book a table for yourself for two or more) as we have limited dining spaces allocated. As this is a very popular venue that gets booked out weeks in advance I have payed a hefty non refundable deposit to book our main table which will then be substracted from the final food/dinner drinks bill for each person. So If you're coming for dinner you need to send me a private message so I can share payment details for pre-booking your place at table (£10 per person). Do NOT turn up for the dinner if I have not booked and paid your deposit in advance. You will be turned away.</p> <p>Venue wil be shared the day before - it is in Camden town so almost in central london zone 2 with access by buses, underground and overground.</p> <p>Your Bollywood Singing Dancin Superstar - Lucas Kumar</p> ",

People with science backgrounds are definitely welcome. We'll also try to touch on the empirical literature/evidence for paranormal phenomena &amp; potential explanations including ( I can share research studies with you) :</p> <p>\\- Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?</p> <p>\\- Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" \\(quantum entanglement\\) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?</p> <p>\\- What existed before the universe \\- how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play and suggest about unknown dimensions and out understanding of entwined space and time?</p> <p>\"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking once said. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?</p> <p>\\- Is the near death experieince phenomena millions have experienced a result of neurochemical and hormonal changes that occur in the body &amp; brain close to death \\(esp\\. in truma conditions\\) or something beyond physicality?</p> <p>\\- Given neuroscience research is in it's infancy relative to other areas of medicine/science and so there is yet still so little understanding of the brain\\, could mediation help to access additional functions that are not available when we are operate in BAU alpha\\, beta and gamma brainwaves phases?</p> <p>\\- As well as the brain \\- studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons\\.

What is it that makes them stand out and unique? Does the song have personal relevance to you? Are the lyrics poetic or a philosophical masterpiece like in some old hip-hop or is it about the sound of the vocals or hypnotic melodies? Did the song (or artist) play a pivotal role in shaping political change &amp; influence in society (yes some musicians even died for their artform) or the evolution of new music genres, sub cultures and underground music movements today? Was Lennon &amp; McCartney the greatest ever singer song writer combo or have you heard better? Who are the best all time music producers &amp; song writers - Max Martin, Billy Joel, George Martin, Quincy Jones, Bernie Taupin, Dr Dre, Carole King? Did PWL records destroy British music or contribute to it?</p> <p>We can also touch on influential music producers, labels, DJs and radio stations as well. Discussion on all elements of musicology and enablers is up for grabs!</p> <p>If you can - come prepared with links to samples (feel free to post youtube and other links in the comments section below) to demonstrate or be willing to sing/rap some lyrics so we can get an idea.

Start of US Fed tightening and implications for global asset prices (stocks, US dollar, crypo, bond yields, property) and outllook for inflation &amp; growth.<br/>2. Current valuations and risk of market crash and or bear market for the major indices (Nasdax already hit bear in March with some junk tech stocks down by 90%), Are we in a bear market rally from the March lows (my view we are) or will we see new highs soon as continuance of existing cyclical bull? The current disconnect between equities and bonds. One is likely wrong - which one?<br/>3. Geo political events including but not limited to Russian invasion, financial sanctions and spillovers to global markets and economies. Also keeping a close eye on the Chinese economy along with the political situation and full lockdowns of major cities (Shanghai). Something does not sound right with this variant. Does the govt have ulterior motives - crippling the the global economy?<br/>4. Depth of Fed tightening policy and credibility. Many economists pricing in at least 6-8 rate hikes along with balance sheet reduction starting May. If inflation persists above target how far will they go before they crash the markets and cause a global recession and unemployment? Because they are so behind the curve - it might be the price they have to pay now to get inflation back under control (nearest parallel here - UK, America and Europe in 70s/80s). Is the current yield curve inversion correct in forecasting a recession or is it a false signal?<br/>5. Market Sentiment &amp; Earnings - seems lots of investors out there with recency bias who have never traded in high inflation regime and thought the Fed will not even raise in March still with buy the dip mentality! Beware Beware. And many don't even seem to comprehend the link between growth slowdown already underway in Europe and US which will drive lower company earnings / misses (not withstanding stock buybacks). Current sentiment based on a range of indicators seems to be out of whack with future fundamentals<br/>6. UK interest rate rises / monetary policy tightening because of high inflation (Dec RPI 7.5%) and implications for house prices &amp; economy<br/>7. Risks from Covid Omicron variant - are will yet to see global economy impact or is it already now largely contained?</p> <p>Lucas (Macro Economist, Trader/Investor &amp; Ex Reuters Journalist)<br/>DISCLAIMER- Nothing written here or any views shared in person at the meetup event should be construed as investment or trading advice</p> ",

After the band finishes around 11, we'll drop some funky moves and singalong to some europhoric tunes spun by a really good verstile DJ mashing up multi decade eclectic tunes verse by verse until 2.30AM. It's gonna be jam hot!!</p> <p>Of course you don't actually need to get up on stage and sing - as long as you love music - you are welcome to sing, cheer and dance along with the vibrant crowd.</p> <p>\\#\\#\\#\\# For The Singers \\#\\#\\#\\#<br/>If you've never sung with a real band before and want to sing with the band then make sure you know your song and lyrical placement/timing as this is NOT Karoake or a studio jamming session!</p> <p>You don't necessarily need vocals like Mariah Carey but you must at least be able to carry a tune or the band will think you're takin the piss! Usually we have two guitarists, a drummer and two backing vocalists. Note that song options are likely to be confined to mainstream soul/blues, pop, rock genres mutiple spanning decades from contemporary to classics so there should be a song for everyone (as long as you don't take one of my songs!)</p> <p>This is a join event with another group so the number of RSVPs will be higher than what you see here. So limiting RSVPs because the place will be very busy with Islington trendies and so there will be limited slots for songs.

You don't need a telescope as you will be able to view through scopes belonging to me and other club members (as long as you behave responsibily and don't temper with equipment worth several thousands). If you have your own telescope feel free to bring it along also and I can help you with setting up if you're a newbie.</p> <p>Alcoholic beverage (wine, beer, cider only), hot drinks and food/snacks will be available to purchase at the observation point/warm indoor cafe with seating area and outside (glass) view of the park.</p> <p>====ITINERARY=====<br/>Meet outside Camden Tube Station at 7.00 PM. After a short wait for anyone delayed, I will escort everyone to the observation point in Regent's Park and brief everyone in terms what to expect and instructions for interacting with any Telescopes. The walk will take 15-20 mins max. Around 10.45 or earlier if the weather turns sour, we will leave and I will walk the group back to Camden. Alternatively people can also take a bus or walk from the observation point to Baker Street. Sometimes a few of us go for a drink in Camden afterwards. I will send out my contact number to people who have reserved for the event in case you have of any issues finding us.</p> <p>===What Can You Expect To See (this time of year)? =====<br/>- Orion Nebula<br/>- Asteroid 4 (Vesta)<br/>- Comet Neo<br/>- International Space station fly by<br/>- Venus &amp; Mercury early evening post sunset<br/>- Jupiter and 4 moons<br/>- Neptune<br/>- UranUus<br/>- Mars<br/>- Our moon, binary star systems (think Starwars!),<br/>- Andromedia Galaxy, star clusters such as The Owl Cluster</p> <p>More here from Jodrell Bank Observatory/Astrophysics Centre:<br/><a href=\"http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/</a></p> <p>Guide to viewing the cosmos for beginners:<br/><a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp\" class=\"linkified\">https://phys.org/news/2018-05-universe-distant-starstips-cosmology-backyard.html#jCp</a></p> <p>=========HEALTH &amp; SAFETY==============<br/>If you feel in any way unwell prior to the event (even if you just have a minor headache, cold/cough, have been sneezing) please do not attend.

We'll also pass some famous theatres, world famous courts (Royal courts of Justice), the original Bank of England and other landmarks in tha area.</p> <p>The tour will end with drinks and refreshments between 5 - 5.30pm (where you can also order food) in a surprise venue towards Kings Coss where TV (ITN/Channel 4/Channel 5) journalists still hang out after work to this very day! We might even spot a celebrity newscaster or three.</p> <p>And oh boy - if I'm feeling musical - I might just sing/whistle that first line that A Day In The Life Beatles song and maybe the rest of it as well.</p> <p>Actual RSVPs are actually higher than what you see here as I have people attending from my cultural &amp; educational event group.</p> <p>Correspondent &amp; DJ Lucas (ex Reuters, Groove Radio)</p> ",

We'll also try to touch on finding empirical evidence for paranormal phenomena &amp; potential explanations including:</p> <p># How/why are we here? Do we live in a simulation like Musk &amp; DeGrasse postulate and if so simulated by whom? Are there multi/parallel universes? Could the multiverse and simulation hypotheses help to explain some (claimed) supernatural &amp; pyschological phenomena?</p> <p># Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" (quantum entanglement) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?</p> <p># Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?</p> <p># What existed before the universe - how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play?</p> <p># \"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?</p> <p># As well as the brain - studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in the Last Christmas film?</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT &amp; COVID SAFETY =================<br/>We'll meet inside The Tom Cribb in Central London. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group. I'll be wearing a Starwars identifier and also share table location on the day.</p> <p>The event is subject to securing at least 8 confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend. In the case of a waiting list - priority will be given to people than can demonstrate a genuine interest in the subject area, acquaintances and most loyal members.</p> <p>Remember our jingo - great fun interesting meetups for a great city for free with Chillout London.</p> <p>Guru Master Lucas</p> ",

Start of US Fed tightening and implications for global asset prices (stocks, US dollar, crypocurrencies, bond yields, property), inflation &amp; economies.<br/>2. Current valuations and risk of market crash, bear market, correction for the major indices (had 5% already for S&amp;P, some Nasdax tech stocks down up to 90% already!).<br/>3. Geo political events including but not limited to Russian Invasion, financial sanctions and spillovers to global markets and economies<br/>4. Will the Fed tighten significantly or they just telling the mkts what they want to hear? If inflation persists above target how far can they go before they crash the markets and cause a global recession or major slowdown (already underway)? Lots of invetors out there with recency bias who think the Fed will not even raise in March. Most have never lived through a pre GFC high inflation era or learnt their economics history - are we in for some scary times?<br/>5. UK interest rate rises / monetary policy tightening because of high inflation (Dec RPI 7.5%) and implications for house prices &amp; economy<br/>6. Risks from Covid Omicron variant - are will yet to see global economy impact or is it already now largely contained?</p> <p>Lucas (Macro Economist, Trader/Investor &amp; Ex Reuters Journalist)</p> ",

We'll also try to touch on finding empirical evidence for paranormal phenomena &amp; potential explanations including:</p> <p># How/why are we here? Do we live in a simulation like Musk &amp; DeGrasse postulate and if so simulated by whom? Are there multi/parallel universes? Could the multiverse and simulation hypotheses help to explain some (claimed) supernatural &amp; pyschological phenomena?<br/># Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" (quantum entanglement) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?<br/># Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?<br/># What existed before the universe - how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play?<br/># \"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?<br/># As well as the brain - studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in the Last Christmas film?</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT &amp; COVID SAFETY =================<br/>We'll meet outside Kings Cross Station and then walk to the venue 5 mins away. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group.</p> <p>The event is subject to securing at least 8 confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend. In the case of a waiting list - priority will be given to people than can demonstrate a genuine interest in the subject area, acquaintances and most loyal members.</p> <p>If you feel in any way unwell prior to the event please do not attend. And do not shake hands unless you have washed them after arriving. Everyone is encouraged to take on LFT a few hours before.</p> <p>Remember our jingo - great fun interesting meetups for a great city for free with Chillout London.</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

What is it that makes them stand out and unique? Does the song have personal relevance to you? Are the lyrics poetic or a philosophical masterpiece like in some old hip-hop or is it about the sound of the vocals or hypnotic melodies? Did the song (or artist) play a pivotal role in shaping political change &amp; influence in society (yes some musicians even died for their artform) or the evolution of new music genres, sub cultures and underground music movements today? Was Lennon &amp; McCartney the greatest ever singer song writer combo or have you heard better? Who are the best all time music producers &amp; song writers - Max Martin, Billy Joel, George Martin, Quincy Jones, Bernie Taupin, Dr Dre, Carole King? Did PWL records destroy British music or contribute to it?</p> <p>We can also touch on influential music producers, labels, DJs and radio stations as well. Discussion on all elements of musicology and enablers is up for grabs!</p> <p>If you can - come prepared with links to samples (feel free to post youtube and other links in the comments section below) to demonstrate or be willing to sing/rap some lyrics so we can get an idea. Funky dance moves optional.</p> <p>The event will only go ahead if we have at least 8 people confirmed For drinks I have a limited spaces for 15 so please confirm if you will be joining or not - this will be on first confirmed first come basis.</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================<br/>We will meet outside Camden Town Station (Camden High Street exist) and go to my favourite pub in Camden - the very unique Elephants Head with a brillant vibe, very friendly people from all around the world (look out for Johnny Depp, Gaddafi &amp; John Lennon) and music spanning decades from the 50s to contemporary and every style.

Alternatively people can also take a bus or walk from the observation point to Baker Street. Sometimes a few of us go for a drink in Camden afterwards.

        "description": "<p>Join for chilled afternoon of engaging &amp; thought provoking \"sprituality\" chatter, free tarot, I Ching reading over coffee in very warm cosy lounge - perfect for chilling out Sunday to nurse that heavy post Saturday night hangover!</p> <p>Yes - the only differentiated coffee event with mind numbing small talk left at home &amp; with Chillout's resident chaming American Tarot card Reader &amp; Astrologer offering free readings - just for a bit of fun of course!</p> <p>But if you're intellectually curious, inquisitive, open minded, interested in the deep questions and potential links to noetic sciences &amp; consciousness then is defo for you. We'll also try to touch on finding empirical evidence for paranormal phenomena &amp; potential explanations including:</p> <p># How/why are we here? Do we live in a simulation like Musk &amp; DeGrasse postulate and if so simulated by whom? Are there multi/parallel universes? Could the multiverse and simulation hypotheses help to explain some (claimed) supernatural &amp; pyschological phenomena?<br/># Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" (quantum entanglement) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?<br/># Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in asserting if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence for ghost particles making Ouija boards kids play?<br/># What existed before the universe - how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play?<br/># \"The past, like the future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities.\" Stephen Hawking. If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness not only defines the existence of the universe and perceived reality but also our destiny? Could quantum cosmology then account for what happens to us?<br/># As well as the brain - studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in the Last Christmas film?</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT &amp; COVID SAFETY =================<br/>We'll meet outside Kings Cross Station and then walk to the venue 5 mins away. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group.</p> <p>The event is subject to securing at least 8 confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend. In the case of a waiting list - priority will be given to people than can demonstrate a genuine interest in the subject area, acquaintances and most loyal members.</p> <p>If you feel in any way unwell prior to the event please do not attend. And do not shake hands unless you have washed them after arriving. Everyone is encouraged to take on LFT a few hours before.</p> <p>Remember our jingo - great fun interesting meetups for a great city for free with Chillout London.</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

        "description": "<p>For passionate music fans whose first love is music - sing real time with a live band on stage in this neat little chilled out fun local Islington boozer packed with a young trendy crowd for a musically thrilled night with a difference!</p> <p>If you've never sung with a band before and want to sing on the night make sure you know your song and lyrical placement/timing as this is NOT Karoake or a studio jamming session!</p> <p>You don't need to be able to sing like Sam Cooke but you must at least be able to carry a tune or the band will think you're takin the piss! Usually we have two guitarists, a drummer and two backing vocalists. Note that song options are likely to be confined to mainstream soul/blues, pop, rock genres mutiple spanning decades from contemporary to classics so there should be a song for everyone</p> <p>Of course you don't actually need to sing - as long as you love music - you are welcome, sing along, watch/get drunk/cheer on, dance to music. After the band finishes around 11.30 there's a really good DJ mashing up some multi decade eclectic tunes verse by verse until 2.30AM. Alternatively we might go to Amy Winehouse's local in Camden later in the eve for some reminiscing and a singalong as we always do @ the UK's home of music. Then we'll grab a kebab/burger as dinner from the mainy late night cafes on the way home.</p> <p>Limiting RSVPs because the place will be very busy with Joe public and so there will be limited slots for singing songs.</p> <p>The venue will be: Radicals &amp; Victuallers, 59 Upper St, London N1 0NY</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

What is it that makes them stand out and unique? Does the song have personal relevance to you? Are the lyrics poetic or a philosophical masterpiece like in some old hip-hop or is it about the sound of the vocals or hypnotic melodies? Did the song (or artist) play a pivotal role in shaping political change &amp; influence in society (yes some musicians even died for their artform) or the evolution of new music genres, sub cultures and underground music movements today? Was Lennon &amp; McCartney the greatest ever singer song writer combo or have you heard better? Who are the best all time music producers &amp; song writers - Max Martin, Billy Joel, George Martin, Quincy Jones, Bernie Taupin, Dr Dre, Carole King? Did PWL records destroy British music or contribute to it?</p> <p>We can also touch on influential music producers, labels, DJs and radio stations as well. Discussion on all elements of musicology and enablers is up for grabs!</p> <p>If you can - come prepared with links to samples (feel free to post youtube and other links in the comments section below) to demonstrate or be willing to sing/rap some lyrics so we can get an idea. Funky dance moves optional.</p> <p>The event will only go ahead if we have at least 8 people confirmed For drinks I have a limited spaces for 15 so please confirm if you will be joining or not - this will be on first confirmed first come basis.</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT =================<br/>We will meet outside Camden Town Station (Camden High Street exist) and go to my favourite pub in Camden - the Elephants Head.

        "description": "<p>How are you doin? A few years ago I presented the above slide to a client to push a marketing strategy to make this day more happier for their customers. Urban myth or not - Chillout London is drawing on it's own advice to turn Blue Monday into Happy Monday by offering everyone something fun to do in the same week where we simultaneously freeze in the lowest temperatures of the entire year (northern hemisphere)</p> <p>One of the explanatory drivers here is low cash flows so I will make this event dirt cheap but it will take more than just a nice coffee! Tonight is going to be all about laughing at a free comedy club in the heart of Islington that broke current fanous British comedians including Ramesh Ranganathan and Josie Long!</p> <p>We were meet outside Angel Station. Make sure you come armed with your best joke because no matter how bad it is we wanna hear it! If you're late join us at the Camden Head 5 mins away but get there for before 8pm as it gets very busy and you will be refused entry.</p> <p>Venue: Camden Head<br/>Angel, Islington<br/>2 Camden Walk, London N1 8DY<br/>Phone number will be shared 10 mins before meet time in case you can't find us</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

We'll also try to touch on empirical evidence for paranormal phenomena including:</p> <p>- How/why are we here? Do we live in simulation like some great scientific minds postulate and if so simulated by whom? Are there multi/parallel universes? Could the multiverse and simulation hypotheses help to explain some (claimed) supernatural &amp; pyschological phenomena?<br/>Is synchronicity/coincidence simply randomness disguised in the eye of the beholder? Or can what Einstein famously called “spooky action at a distance\" (quantum entanglement) and other obsevational phenomena help to explain?<br/>- What existed before the universe - how can you get something from nothing and conversely the reverse? What role does quantum physics play?<br/>- Does life after death exist or is Professor Brian Cox right in postulating that if ghosts really existed then particle accelerators at CERN would of already uncovered evidence?<br/>- If some forms of matter are not real until they are observed as quantum mechanics repeatedly finds does that mean consciousness could define our destiny?<br/>- As well as the brain - studies show the heart also contain thousands of neurons. Does this mean it also plays a role in our consciousness and give credibility to the theme tackled in the Last Christmas film (we love you're music George Michael/Wham)?</p> <p>=========RENDEZVOUS POINT &amp; COVID SAFETY =================<br/>We will meet outside Kings Cross Station and then walk to the venue 5 mins away. I'll send out my number to attendees a couple of hours before the event in case of issues finding the group.</p> <p>The event is subject to securing at least six confirmed RSVPs with 100% intent to attend. In the case of a waiting list - priority will be given to people than can demonstrate a genuine interest in the subject area, acquaintances and most loyal members.</p> <p>If you feel in any way unwell prior to the event please do not attend. And do not shake hands unless you have washed them after arriving. Everyone is encouraged to take on LFT a few hours before.</p> <p>Remember our jingo - great meetups for a great city for free with Chillout London.</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Avoid the tourists &amp; exorbitant drink prices of the West End by joining for an exuberant fun filled night of friendly stimulating chatter, dancing &amp; party antics in professional but young vibrant creative Kings Cross / Islington - the trendiest place in town to see in 2022 with euthoric sounds of the 70s, 80s, 90s &amp; 00s back in vogue! Note this is a ticketed event - please read details fully below.</p> <p>With exclusive venue hire including a heated roof terrace - the party shenanigans will kick off around 8PM with a champagne reception &amp; snacks (for the first 60 people) where we'll converse and banter for the first couple of hours against a backdrop of chilled hypnotising melodies. Later the DJ will pump up the volume to groove you through to the early morning light with eclectic euphoric singalong &amp; funky party tunes! We're taking no responsibilities for hangovers, sore limbs and recollection of faint but embarrassing memories the day after that will no doubt follow!</p> <p>=====HOW TO PURCHASE TICKETS=====<br/>Most of my events are free but as the 31st is the busiest night of the year with venues packed out - unfortunately this is a ticketed event. You must purchase ticket in advance else you will be turned away. Please use the following link to secure your place:<br/><a href=\"https://fatso.ma/VmLP\" class=\"linkified\">https://fatso.ma/VmLP</a></p> <p>Mega Early Bird £10 - Ticket for 1 Person / Sold Out<br/>Early Bird £15 - Ticket for 1 Person / Sold Out<br/>Standard £25 - Ticket for 1 Person / Sold Out<br/>Premium/Last Minute £30 - Ticket for 1 Person/ Last Few Remaining</p> <p>TICKET LINK: <a href=\"https://fatso.ma/VmLP\" class=\"linkified\">https://fatso.ma/VmLP</a></p> <p>=====Venue &amp; Plan=====<br/>The new year will unveil at the street trendy but smart - The Fellow in Islington/Kings Cross North London, featuring a bistro bar downstairs, a classy cocktail bar for the more discerning upstairs and a secret heated roof terrace next level up to Chillout - perfect to get in some fresh outdoor air to keep Covid at Bay. If it looks like a clear night, I will bring my telescope so we can do some planet/star gazing from up there!</p> <p>Note this is a JOIN EVENT run in conjunction with other groups so the number of collective RSVPs/attendees is much higher then what you see on the list. In 2019 we had over 230 people attend. Once the waiting list activates I will weigh priority towards my regular attendees / acquaintances and locals to the venue.</p> <p>On arrival, tell door security that the reservation is booked under Socialite Connections / Meetup /Michelle. You will be directed to the VIP area where your name will be checked against the guestlist and you will be given a welcome drink (champagne) and a wristband. The welcome drink will only be served to the first 60 people who arrive before 9pm or until we run out.</p> <p>This event will be fully hosted with very fun socially skilled organisers - including myself - on site to introduce you and ignite stimulating conversations with other like minded professionals. If you're coming on your own it's advised to arrive before 9.30 PM so that intros can be made whilst music is still at low volume.</p> <p>=== Directions &amp; Ensuring Covid Safe Environment ====<br/>Nearest tube station is Kings Cross Station/St Pancras - 2 mins walk away, Full address: The Fellow, 24 York Way, London, N1 9AA</p> <p>Please arrive between 8pm- 10pm no later, as it gets very busy and the queue will be long. By 10pm, it will be 1 out / 1 in.</p> <p>COVID Safe Venue<br/>With a heated terrance rooftop the venue offers covid safe option for those concerned about spread. But everyone needs to do their bit as well. You'll need a covid pass to attend. People will need to use their NHS COVID PASS to gain entry as per the new Government rule. Make sure that you take a screen shot of the QR Code or show proof of a negative result from a recent lateral flow test.<br/><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass#how-to-use-the-nhs-covid-pass-at-venues-events-and-settings-in-england\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-covid-pass#how-to-use-the-nhs-covid-pass-at-venues-events-and-settings-in-england</a></p> <p>Vaccainated or not - everyone is encouraged to take a lateral flow test a couple of hours before arrival to reduce spread of virus and protect others.</p> <p>See you New Years Eve and if not - whatever you end up doing - have a brilliant ecstatic one.</p> <p>Lucas</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Being relatively new to this malarkey, I have volunteered to lead a walk in Martin’s absence. The only walk I feel confident in leading relates to Tring’s canal paths and reservoirs, both of great beauty and wildlife interest. <br/>After meeting in the centre of Tring at the Forge Car Park, my aim is to minimize walking through the urban sprawl as best I can. <br/>We leave from the car park through quaint alleyways, entering the charm of Spider Park, continuing past the back of the picturesque houses that form Rosebery Way and Kingsley Walk. Next we will encounter the hedonistic delights of Old Joe’s Wood, before crossing the Icknield Way towards Little Tring. Soon, after a brief hike through a short overgrown pathway, we will be in open country accompanied by gentle sheep and cows. A slightly undulating hike will take us towards the village of Wilstone crossing the Wendover Arm of the canal, skirting the reservoir and passing through this lovely village, where we join the Aylesbury Arm of the Grand Union Canal. Here we follow the canal eastwards, passing close by to Marsworth and then skirting Startops reservoir. <br/>Following the canal path towards Bulbourne, we have have a decision to make ….. turn right and follow the Wendover Arm back towards Tring (past Heygates) or continue on ( past the Grand Junction ) and to return to Tring, via Marshcroft Lane (perhaps, Martin, an experienced leader would decide in advance!!). <br/>On arriving back at the car park in Tring, we have another decision to make …. Mimi’s (not dog friendly) or The Robin Hood (very dog friendly). <br/>Hope you will support me on my debut and please be gentle with me if I c\\*\\*k up!!</p> ",

The latest entry in her series about globetrotting lovers isn’t selling so well, given that it reads like a eulogy with sex scenes; its details about an ancient civilization in South America, however, have attracted the interest of Daniel Radcliffe’s evil, cheerful billionaire. He thinks she knows where a hidden treasure is and, one abduction later, Bullock’s reluctant Indiana Jones in a magenta sequined catsuit is clomping around the deep jungle. Tatum’s dim-witted himbo, who harbours a schoolboy crush for the wordsmith, is determined to rescue her.<br/>The next hour is a hilarious procession of flying fists, trashed charcuterie buffets and a scene-stealing cameo by a tousled Brad Pitt. The Lost City has a genuine buoyancy that is hard to resist. Most comedies are afraid to go big, but this one most definitely does.</p> <p>Trailer:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfKO9rYDmE8\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfKO9rYDmE8</a></p> <p>Parking in Berkhamsted is very difficult but there is road parking along Three Close Lane.

My contact number is[masked].</p> <p>The Misbourne is a modern success story and a testament to the efforts of campaigners to rescue it. A natural chalk stream, water companies were attracted to its exceptionally pure water and by the 1990s it was one of the worst affected rivers in the country for abstraction. A new pipeline was built from more sustainable sources and the river was rescued, and this circular walk gives you the opportunity to enjoy a stretch of it, as well as the delights of Old Amersham. It begins in the town, but soon heads up the side of the valley cut by the river to afford great views, although there is a climb involved first to earn them. The river itself is your companion for much of the second half of the walk, and includes a delightful stopping point by a ford, great for picnics or a paddle. At the walk's end there's the opportunity to take in a monument to seven Protestant martyrs burned at the stake in the 16th century, as well as the opportunity to sample part of Old Amersham. Here you can see the King's Arms, which featured as The Lucky Boatman in the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', as well as a number of historical buildings. Allow a couple of hours for this five and half mile walk.</p> <p>After the walk, we can visit the Saracens Head pub which is very welcoming and serves well-priced food.</p> <p>We can meet in the Old Amersham car park, the post code is HP7 0UT.

We should finish in ample time to enjoy the hospitality at the Greyhound Inn.<br/>This 5.4 mile walk takes us through rolling wooded countryside and steep chalk grassland. The walk follows typical Chiltern sunken lanes that criss-cross the area. The walk begins in the picturesque village of Aldbury. There is some parking space in front of the Greyhound pub and around the pond but another option is in the car park further along Stocks Road. We walk uphill through the Stocks golf club and into the woods to pick up the Ridgeway where there is one steep climb to Aldbury Nowers which is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) managed by the Hertfordshire and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. We continue across open countryside towards Ivinghoe Beacon but cut back to walk uphill towards the Ashridge estate woodland and along Duncombe Terrace. At the Bridgewater Monument we head downhill to return to Aldbury.<br/>The walk should take less than 2.5 hours and once we return to Aldbury, there is the option to take refreshments in the Greyhound where there is a spacious beer garden.<br/>The address for the pub is The Greyhound, Stocks Road, Aldbury, Nr Tring.

Decades on, the heart-pounding sequel finally soars onto screen.<br/>30 years after the events of the original, Maverick has been constantly dodging promotion so he can do what he loves most; fly planes. He’s about to be grounded for good when he’s sent back to Top Gun to train a group of pilots for a top-secret mission that will be the ultimate test of their skills. Little does he know, it will also be an exercise that allows him to put his past to rest.<br/>You have to hand it to Tom Cruise. Who else could anchor a bigger, brighter blockbuster than this? Creating a worthy sequel to a near-legendary film can be a minefield. And when that movie was released over a generation ago, the stakes are even higher. White-knuckle from beginning to end, Maverick pulls it off in every way imaginable.<br/>Follow-ups are a regular part of our cinematic diet, but this is a real game-changer. Like its pilots, and especially their leader, Top Gun: Maverick has joined the elite. This is how it’s done.</p> <p>Trailer:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSqVVswa420\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSqVVswa420</a></p> <p>Parking in Berkhamsted is very difficult but there is road parking along Three Close Lane.

The route then diverts into open countryside before regaling the walker with a magnificent view of the large Wilstone Reservoir, one of four on this walk. Here, there this an option to enter a bird hide to view the many species who call this water their home at different times of the year. The other reservoirs follow, making this a relaxing 5.4 miles of relatively easy walking following a circular route. Allow a good couple of hours to complete the walk, longer if you want to linger.<br/>The walk starts at Startops Reservoir, which is clearly signposted as one of the Marsworth Reservoirs on the B489 linking the A41 to the north east of Aston Clinton and Linslade. Marsworth lies in a little remnant of Hertfordshire to the north of Tring, and can also be reached using the Wingrave Road out of the town off the B488. Use the postcode HP23 4LJ, which is also the location of the lovely little Waters Edge cafe by the side of the canal just off the main car park. We can go to the tearoom after the walk for a snack and chat.<br/>The car park does carry a charge with funds used to maintain the reservoirs.</p> <p>Please note that this walk is not led by a qualified leader and, as such, isn't covered by insurance.

A natural chalk stream, water companies were attracted to its exceptionally pure water and by the 1990s it was one of the worst affected rivers in the country for abstraction. A new pipeline was built from more sustainable sources and the river was rescued, and this circular walk gives you the opportunity to enjoy a stretch of it, as well as the delights of Old Amersham. It begins in the town, but soon heads up the side of the valley cut by the river to afford great views, although there is a climb involved first to earn them. The river itself is your companion for much of the second half of the walk, and includes a delightful stopping point by a ford, great for picnics or a paddle. At the walk's end there's the opportunity to take in a monument to seven Protestant martyrs burned at the stake in the 16th century, as well as the opportunity to sample part of Old Amersham. Here you can see the King's Arms, which featured as The Lucky Boatman in the film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', as well as a number of historical buildings. Allow a couple of hours for this five and half mile walk.</p> <p>We can meet in the Old Amersham car park, the post code is HP7 0UT. For those using What3words, solar.forest.cards .</p> ",

You will even have a chance to question the suspects, who all seem very ﬁshy…<br/>The scenario: Rob Cockyn is in serious ﬁnancial trouble. His chain of ﬁsh and chip restaurants, largely ﬁnanced by loans from business associates and an ex-lover, is facing bankruptcy. Rob has been forced to call a creditors’ meeting. But has he had his chips? Will it ﬂounder? Are all the ﬁsh puns just red herrings?<br/>The evening begins at 7:45. Please note that there will not be a bar at this performance.</p> <p>There isn't a convenient car park in Bovingdon, unfortunately, so it's best to arrive early to find a space along the road.</p> ",

After what must have felt like a gruelling wait, the new era is finally upon us.<br/>Julian Fellowes is back on board as curator, and he had the following to say: \"It really is a new era. The further the ’20s went along, the more the world was changing in so many ways. Everything from entertainment to transport was really different by the end of the ’20s. As we know from the last film, Mary may not be the titular head of the household, but she is effectively running the show. We take that further. We’re trying to mark the change — the fact that Crawleys of Downton are nearly in the 1930s, which is merely the beginning of the modern world.\"<br/>The first film featured the Crawley family receiving a visit by the King and Queen to their family estate. There were plenty of questions left over that need to be addressed too: How is Mary handling the responsibility of managing the Crawley estate? Did Lady Edith Crawley safely deliver her child? Downton fans won’t be disappointed.</p> <p>Trailer:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0Spmq610Q\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0Spmq610Q</a></p> <p>Parking in Berkhamsted is very difficult but there is road parking along Three Close Lane.

Let me know if you wish to pay by another method.</p> <p>OVO’s brand new musical Shakespeare transports audiences to the glittering, hustling, hip swivelling age of disco.<br/>In the beige 1970s in a down at heel working men’s club somewhere in the north of England, barman Nick Bottom dreams of a music career. The only problem is, he can’t sing. Meanwhile, Mia, Helen, Dean and Andy are drinking, snogging, arguing and fighting - much to the disapproval of their parents. But then... It all gets a bit messy. A mystical figure appears. And they are all transported to a rather different sort of club. Once there they find themselves wrapped in the dream-like arms of an enchanted fun palace where games of fantasy and love ensue. Where a new dance craze called disco is like a religion, and its masters are like gods. But will Nick discover his voice? Will Mia, Andy, Helen and Dean be reconciled? And will some of the disco world’s magic rub off on the uneventful lives they left behind?<br/>This promises to be The Dream as you’ve never seen it before – featuring some of the best dance music ever produced, from the likes of Abba, Gloria Gaynor, Bee Gees, Donna Summer, The Jacksons and many more. So come and join our live band at the Midsummer Party. If you enjoyed our 80s rock festival Merry Wives of Windsor, and our As You Like It set in the summer of love, then this is the show for you.</p> <p>Parking is tricky so it's best to get there as soon as possible. It's possible to park in local streets but these are likely to fill up quickly.</p> ",

Featuring two episodes that have never been brought to the stage before.</p> <p>In Turkey Dinner, Jones’ section accidently shoots a turkey whilst on patrol and Mainwaring insists they compensate the owner. The owner cannot be found, so they organise a Christmas dinner for the old age pensioners of Walmington.</p> <p>In Never Too Old (the final episode of the series), Jones surprises the platoon by announcing he’s going to marry Mrs Fox. The platoon carries on, whilst plans for his big day get underway. Mrs Fox asks Mainwaring back to her flat and asks him for a favour.</p> <p>The performance begins at 7.30pm but we can meet up for a chat and a drink in the bar area at 7pm.

He was, in fact, a figment of a team of British Intelligence officers’ imagination and part of what became known as one of the greatest deception operations in military history: Operation Mincemeat. Based on Ben Macintyre’s book of the same name, here John Madden (previously known for Shakespeare in Love and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel films) tensely traces Operation Mincemeat from conception to completion.<br/>When Ewen Montagu KC (Colin Firth) announces his retirement the night before his wife and children depart for America without him, his brother Ivor (Mark Gatiss) suspects he has a new, covert occupation lined up. Indeed, Ewen has been hired by British Intelligence to assist with a ploy to deceive the Nazis of the location of an impending invasion. With family-friend Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton), the resourceful Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald) and meticulous Charles Cholmondeley by Ewan’s side it seems to be a winning combination. That is until conflicts of personal affections and egos, combined with pressure from their superiors Admiral John Godfrey (Jason Isaacs) and Churchill (Simon Russell Beale), threaten the success of their plan.</p> <p>Trailer:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7ZXOXHZ20\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ7ZXOXHZ20</a></p> <p>Parking in Berkhamsted is very difficult but there is road parking along Three Close Lane.

The cast are amateurs trying to save their theatre from developers. Jefferson’s ego, vanity and insecurity are tested to the limit by the enthusiastic am-dram thespians. As acting worlds collide and Jefferson’s career implodes, he discovers some truths about himself.<br/>The Stage said that ‘the acerbic wit of Ian Hislop and Nick Newman metamorphoses into some hugely funny one-liners verging on farce in the best possible way’. The Mail on Sunday gave the show four stars, saying it was ‘deliciously stuffed with Shakespeare… a laugh-a-minute’.</p> <p>There is a very large car park at Westminster Lodge which is on the same site as the theatre.</p> ",

Based on the same Scandinavian folk tale that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet, the bloody story follows Amleth, a vengeful 10th century Viking prince who sets out on a quest to kill the man who murdered his father and enslaved his mother, Queen Gudrun (Nicole Kidman). Along the way he meets a mysterious woman, Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), with whom he forms the first real human connection since his childhood.<br/>Eggers, who co-wrote the screenplay with Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, explores basic, primal human nature. From female rage to paternal love there is a brutal and dazzling attention to detail, all played out against the beautiful backdrops of the Nordic islands.</p> <p>If Morbius marked a dismal testament to the present state of Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking, The Northman is every bit the antidote. Challenging, engaging and laced with raw emotion, it’s simply event cinema at its finest.</p> <p>Trailer:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMSdFM12hOw\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMSdFM12hOw</a></p> <p>Parking in Berkhamsted is very difficult but there is road parking along Three Close Lane.

        "description": "<p>For May 2022, we have selected to read a book that is travel writing. The book we have selected is: ‘ Travels with a Tangerine: A journey in the footnotes of Ibn Battutah’ by Tim Mackintosh-Smith. The book was first published in 2001 and the length runs at approximately 368 pages and it is available in most formats, including paperback. The kindle edition is £3.99.</p> <p>About the book:</p> <p>Ibn Battutah set out in 1325 from his native Tangier on the pilgrimage to Mecca. By the time he returned twenty-nine years later, he had visited most of the known world, travelling three times the distance Marco Polo covered. Spiritual backpacker, social climber, temporary hermit and failed ambassador, he braved brigands, blisters and his own prejudices. The outcome was a monumental travel classic.</p> <p>Captivated by this indefatigable man, award-winning travel writer Tim Mackintosh-Smith set out on his own eventful journey, retracing the Moroccan's eccentric trip from Tangier to Constantinople. Tim proves himself a perfect companion to this distant traveller, and the result is an amazing blend of personalities, history and contemporary observation.</p> <p>About the Author:</p> <p>Tim Mackintosh-Smith's first book, YEMEN: TRAVELS IN DICTIONARY LAND won the 1998 Thomas Cook/Daily Telegraph Travel Book Award and is now regarded as a classic of Arabian description. His books on Ibn Battutah's adventures in the old Islamic world and in India have all received huge critical acclaim. LANDFALLS was awarded the Oldie Best Travel Award in 2010 and the Ibn Battutah Prize of Honour by the Arab Centre for Geographical Literature. His journeys in search of Ibn Battutah have also been turned into a major BBC television series. For the past twenty-five years his home has been the Yemeni capital San'a, where he lives in a tower-house on top of the ancient Sabaean city and next door to the modern donkey market. You can find out more about him at www.mackintosh-smith.com</p> <p>__________________________________</p> <p>Critical views:</p> <p>'A brilliant, erudite and entertaining literary coup' ― Time</p> <p>'Battutah couldn't enjoy a better champion . . . This is a considerable book, mind-broadening, not only in the way that it revives the history of a remarkable traveller, but also for its representation of modern Islam as tolerant, hospitable, humorous and cultured' ― The Times</p> <p>'Sometimes, as [Mackintosh-Smith] travels from Cairo to the Crimea, across deserts, into assassins' strongholds, it seems that Ibn Battutah is just a swish of a robe ahead' ― Independent</p> <p>READING AHEAD WITH THE BERK WORMS🐛</p> <p>14 June: Historical Fiction: we are reading The Burning Chambers by Kate Mosse.<br/>12 July: thriller to be selected in May’s meet up<br/>09 August: Dystopian<br/>13 September: history<br/>11 October: psychological<br/>08 November: 19th Century Literature<br/>13 December: Memoirs</p> <p>Happy reading, Cazza</p> ",

Wide, field-edge paths and woodland paths give plenty of space. A relatively easy style-free walk on level paths with about 10 gates and just two short uphill sections. We pass through the Alpine Meadow, the woodland of Frithsden beeches, along Berkhamsted golf course and then skirt around the castle. The walk will take in the historical sites of the World War I trenches and Berkhamsted Castle. There may be a short detour (time and weather permitting) to visit the Berkhamsted Castle visitor centre and learn a bit of history. After the walk we can select one of the many cafes in the town centre.</p> <p>The car park is accessed by Broadwater. Take Lower Kings Road over the canal, turn left into Broadwater and follow the windy road past Berkhamsted Football Club. Please note that there are no public toilets in the car park but it is possible to use the nearby Waitrose facilities. The walk should take 2.5 hours.</p> <p>Please note that this walk is not led by a qualified leader and, as such, isn't covered by insurance. Be sure to wear suitable boots and clothing. The organiser cannot be held responsible for any injuries, however caused. Members are expected to take responsibility for their own preparation and safety including adequate fluids, weather protection and a snack. Please be sure to make me aware if you have any medical conditions.</p> <p>Dogs are welcome as always but please be mindful to keep them on leads for roads and around other animals.</p> <p>If you are unable to attend please be sure to change your RSVP otherwise our departure will be delayed.</p> <p>This walk will go ahead with the recent advice by the government that groups of up to 30 are able to meet outdoors from 17th May.</p> <p>The threat from the virus is very low, especially outdoors, but it is still with us and we should still keep aware of the threat and take the usual precautions, such as considering your own health before attending and social distancing.</p> <p>It is essential that we continue to operate the walks in a covid-secure way so please only RSVP if you agree to the following:<br/>1. Only attend the walks if you have no symptoms or reason to believe you have been exposed to the virus<br/>2. Only attend the walks if you, or anyone you are a carer for, are not in the vulnerable category<br/>3. Greet people without physical contact<br/>4. Walk at a safe distance from others on the walk at least 2 meters apart.</p> <p>Track and trace requirements</p> <p>It is fairly easy for us to operate our own ‘track and trace’ system. If anyone develops symptoms within 2 days after a walk please contact the walk leader as soon as possible so he/she can put contact tracing into operation by alerting other members via Meetup messages. Having taken a Covid test, you should then contact the walk leader who can then inform others of the result.</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This walk is intended mainly for group members who can't usually make the weekday walks, but obviously everyone is welcome.<br/>It starts in the centre of Tring and circum-navigates the three reservoirs (Tringford, Startops End, and Marsworth), with lovely views of the lakes, before heading SE along the Grand Union Canal. The reservoirs are always a good spot to see birds, so I recommend bringing a pair of binoculars for those so inclined.<br/>The latter part of the walk includes a couple of options. For the slightly more energetic, we head down the canal past Bulbourne, to the bridge next to Tring Station, then return to the town via Station Rd, which takes us past the Pendley Manor Hotel.<br/>Alternatively, stop at the Bulbourne bridge, and have a drink or early lunch (served from 12 noon) at the Grand Junction pub, now fully renovated. If the weather's nice, it's delightful to sit in the garden overlooking the canal. After a break, you can stroll back into town via Marshcroft Lane - actually the difference in distance is probably less than a mile.<br/>The walk is around 9.5 kms, call it a little over 6 miles, and since we are beside the lakes and the canal, it is nearly all flat. The footpaths around the lakes are mostly graded gravel, but the canal towpath can be quite muddy if there has been a lot of rain.</p> <p>After the walk we can select one of the many cafes in the town centre.</p> <p>Park at The Forge car park, on Tring High St. The walk should take about 2.5 hours, not counting time out at the Grand Junction!</p> ",

        "description": "<p>This is a photo of me. Doing yoga. Casual. This is how I like to wake up. 5am? No problem. I just leap out of bed and do a headstand. Well, a sort of headstand. A headstand not on my head, but on my arms. I'm also this thin, so that's cool. I'm thin and do headstands not on my head but my arms.<br/>...I'm, of course, joking. It's been a long day and I'm delirious. But if this is a picture of you, please do not attend this workshop. You are not invited.</p> <p>What is hot yoga anyway?<br/>It’s like regular yoga — but hotter.<br/>Hot yoga just means doing yoga in a room that’s heated to an above-average temp, typically between 80 to 100°F (26 to 38°C). It can include any number of poses and music to get your practice flowing. To be honest, I have no idea, but I've wanted to do it forever and the lovely people at Yoga TW12 said we could have our own private class.</p> <p>What are the benefits of hot yoga?</p> <p>After a quick bit of Googling, I discovered hot yoga comes with with many glorious benefits:</p> <p>1. Bendy goodness<br/>It’s no secret that warmed-up muscles just stretch better. Bending and stretching in hotter temps is safer, and it might make those tough poses a little easier to pull off.</p> <p>2. Reduce stress<br/>When life keeps piling on the BS, why not try sweating it out?<br/>In a 2018 study of physically inactive, stressed adults, a 16-week hot yoga program reduced the participants’ stress levels significantly. Fingers crossed for the same improvements in one hour.</p> <p>3. Burn calories<br/>Hot yoga is a solid way to burn calories. A 2014 study found that, on average, women burned 330 calories and men burned 460 calories in a 90-minute Bikram sesh. The hotter temp makes your body work harder than usual. So even if a hot yoga class is less intense than the standard Bikram fare, you’ll still burn more calories than you would in traditional yoga.</p> <p>4. Help your cardiovascular health<br/>The extra heat and humidity make yoga poses more challenging for your heart — a bonus if you want to kick your cardiovascular health up a notch. A 2014 study found that one hot yoga session gets the heart pumping at the same rate as a brisk walk of 3.5 miles per hour.</p> <p>5. Strengthen your bones<br/>Women are at especially high risk for osteoporosis. In a 2014 study, premenopausal women who practised Bikram yoga over a 5-year period had increased bone density in their lower back, hips, and neck. Very cool.</p> <p>6. Lower your blood sugar<br/>If you’re at risk for type 2 diabetes, you might reap extra benefits from hot yoga. To be clear: any type of exercise will help reduce glucose levels in your bloodstream. But a 2013 study found that a short-term hot yoga program boosted glucose tolerance especially well in older adults with obesity.</p> <p>7. Helps with relaxation and mood<br/>Yoga originated in ancient India, where the practice was much more than physical exercise — it had a meditative and spiritual purpose. Today, it’s still well-known for its relaxation and mood-boosting benefits. A 2017 review of 23 studies also concluded that yoga was an effective way to reduce symptoms of depression.</p> <p>8. Nourish your skin and immune system<br/>Don’t let getting soaked by your own perspiration deter you from turning up the heat (or turning up). Sweating in a hot environment can boost your circulation, which helps your immune system work its best. It also can help nourish your skin from the inside out, giving you a rosy glow.

        "description": "<p>There’s pizza, there’s prosecco, there's the magic of Christmas in November – what more could a girl want?? Nothing. That's right. (Except to spend it surrounded by gorgeous gal pals, of course).</p> <p>I've persuaded Franco Manca in Richmond to let us take over their private room downstairs. £25 each and that will get the table piled high with pizzas, a cocktail on arrival and wine &amp; prosecco to flow until the tab runs out. (After that point, feel free to top up any additional drinks yourselves). I'm hoping to get some Christmas games going too, to really get us in the spirit. We need 15 people minimum to reserve the private room.</p> <p>COST:<br/>£25 - includes a selection of pizzas to share, one cocktail on arrival and wine/prosecco until the tab runs out. (At that point please feel free to purchase additional food/drinks as you like - although I think that should more than cover it).</p> <p>WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN:<br/>Any funds leftover will be shared between meetup's cost to run this group (£120) and Solace Women's Aid. We are unbelievably lucky that, for us, the festive season is a time of togetherness and celebration, but Christmas also sees a surge in calls made from women seeking support for domestic abuse, and families needing refuge. Last year, calls to domestic abuse charity, Solace Women’s Aid increased by 77% following the Christmas period. A £10 donation to the charity will support a ‘box of fundamentals’. These boxes, given to each woman who arrives at Solace, include items like shampoo, soap and sanitary products, and are essential in offering women support and protection during the first night’s stay at a refuge. If you'd like to support with an additional donation for the charity, please let me know and I would be delighted to include this. Or you can find out more and donate here: <a href=\"https://www.solacewomensaid.org/news/solace-womens-aid-christmas-campaign-invites-support-women-who-arrive-refuges-nothing\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.solacewomensaid.org/news/solace-womens-aid-christmas-campaign-invites-support-women-who-arrive-refuges-nothing</a></p> <p>HOW TO BOOK:<br/>As usual, space is limited and given on a first-paid-first-reserved basis.<br/>Once you're on the list ping me a message and I'll send you the bank details to reserve your spot. Then check out the menu (link below) and send me your preferences of:<br/>1. pizza<br/>2. welcome cocktail (Aperol Spritz / Negroni / Negroni sbagliato / Gin &amp; Tonic / wine / prosecco)<br/>3. wine/prosecco</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.francomanca.co.uk/menu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.francomanca.co.uk/menu/</a></p> <p>ADDRESS:<br/>(Please note, this is an indoor reservation)<br/>Franco Manca<br/>8 Red Lion Street,<br/>Richmond Upon Thames,<br/>TW9 1RW</p> <p>GETTING THERE:<br/>Plenty of public transport options (please google/citymapper your route). For non-drinkers who might drive, there are a few paid parking options in Richmond town centre - 10 Bridge Street &amp; 5 Friars Lane.</p> <p>NEW MEMBERS:<br/>This is a wonderful opportunity to meet amazing women. If you've not been to any of our meetups before, please don't be nervous - just come along and enjoy.</p> <p>Really looking forward to seeing you all. Any questions, let me know.

        "description": "<p>Hi All!! Lovely Charlie has passed me the reigns to organise a golf session for us all so here it goes...</p> <p>...Ever felt like trying your hand at something new? I’m always looking for lovely ladies to join me on the golf course, at the driving range or even just at the clubhouse for a coffee!</p> <p>So this is the perfect opportunity to give golf a try with a group of lovely women and enjoy a pre-golf lesson coffee or post-lesson drink, depending on how it goes!. If you have played before and don’t feel like you need the golf lesson (aimed at beginners) please come along for the coffee and enjoy the driving range on your own time! But let me know so I can manage the group numbers so we don't go over the 15 person limit for the lesson.</p> <p>Cost:<br/>The lesson will be aimed at beginners and will be £15pp which needs to be pre-paid to reserve your spot (and also is a really good price for group lessons in Surrey, I've heard some places charging up to £35pp for group lessons!). It will be taught by my coach who I’ve been working with for 4 years - he’s very good and super nice. Any drinks/food before or after the lesson you can buy at the venue on the day.</p> <p>Duration:<br/>The session will be 1h30 to ensure everyone gets some direct coaching time with Alex and practice after.</p> <p>When:<br/>Saturday 13th November.<br/>Please come at 10:30am for a coffee meetup beforehand, followed by the coached lesson starting at 11:30am.</p> <p>Location:<br/>We will be doing it at Hersham Golf Club, which is super easy access for those who don’t have a car as the train station is 6 min walk to the golf club. There is also plenty of car parking at the club for those driving.</p> <p>Address:<br/>Assher Rd, Hersham, Walton-on-Thames KT12 4RA (sometimes this takes sat navs to a strange place, so just aim for Hersham Railway Station and you’ll see the signposts).</p> <p>How to book:<br/>Space is limited to 16 people and given on a first-paid-first-reserved basis. Once you're on the list I'll send you a message with the bank details to reserve your spot.</p> <p>Really looking forward to seeing you all there, it might not be the most glorious golf weather in November… but there are covered bays - thank goodness!</p> <p>Also, if you do really like golf or find you enjoy the event so much you want to do it regularly visit the Meetup page below which I just started for women's golf - first event is 27th October!<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/skratch-women-golf-meetup-group/?_ga=2.63848943.158602029.1634496087-569628007.1632061464\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/skratch-women-golf-meetup-group/?_ga=2.63848943.158602029.1634496087-569628007.1632061464</a></p> <p>Cal xx</p> ",

Yum.</p> <p>I've not been here before and we haven't done Kingston in a while, so I'm hoping for good things and out of this world coffee: <a href=\"https://www.beanberrycoffee.com/pages/fife-road\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.beanberrycoffee.com/pages/fife-road</a></p> <p>Agenda:<br/>The usual fabulous, naughty chit chat and gossip, of course, but as well as that, a lovely new member would like to broach the idea of golf with us! Golf has been on my hit list forever, so I'm definitely keen.</p> <p>Attendee Limit:<br/>Because we can't book in advance, I'm keeping the attendee limit to 10. (So please don't put yourself as attending if you're not likely to come - not cool man.)</p> <p>The weather:<br/>This is an indoor booking, but if there's an opportunity to be outside and the weather's fine, we'll take it.</p> <p>New Members:<br/>I'm so pleased to see so many new faces booking on to these meetups. If you're nervous about joining, please don't be. Meeting new, local ladies is what this is all about, after all. All the ladies are so welcoming and fun and you'll have a blast.</p> <p>Getting there:<br/>Address: 30B Fife Road, Kingston upon Thames, KT1 1SZ<br/>Closest public transport is bus (please google/citymapper your route) and overground train. There are a few paid carparks too.</p> <p>Booking etiquette:<br/>Particularly important while attendee numbers are limited - if you can no longer make the meetup (including if you're on the reserve list) please change your RSVP at least 48 hours before the date to give other ladies lucky enough to get your spot time to rearrange their plans to be able to attend. (There's nothing more frustrating than someone dropping out the night before the meetup with no one to take the spot).</p> <p>Please note: We have a \"no show\" policy - three strikes and you're automatically the bottom of the reserve list for future meetups (although, this has never actually happened because you're all so gosh-darned reliable).</p> <p>Really looking forward to seeing you all. Any questions, let me know. Love,</p> <p>Charlie Xx</p> ",

She’s like Elizabeth Taylor in drag, full meltdown, hysteria and hilarity under her considerable bosom. And as ever, the inimitable Edith Massey provides adorable support as bestie Cuddles Kovinsky.</p> <p>Initially, according to Waters, Divine was resistant to the role of frustrated housewife Francine Fishpaw. She found the costumes and greasy black wig less than glamorous. but it was the prospect of kisses from seasoned matinee pin-up Tab Hunter that changed her mind, and she insisted on many retakes… Strictly for accuracy’s sake, you understand!</p> <p>The storyline is full of the obligatory dramatic tropes: Francine is trapped in a loveless marriage to pornographer Elmer (David Samson) her disco crazed daughter Lu Lu (Mary Garlington) is pregnant and son Dexter (Ken King) is skipping school to cause footstomping mayhem. Surely love interest Todd can save her? Of COURSE not! This is John Waters, bitches!!! And when it all falls apart, it’s actually genuinely affecting. You can’t help but feel for poor, misguided Francine.</p> <p>What elevates this, apart from the typical trashy lunacy of our moustachioed hero’s script, is the addition of Odorama, the scratch and sniff card, a homage to sensation cinema of the sixties, from the likes of William Castle.</p> <p>Waters was always unique: this satirical eighties gem, having a pop at the religious right, teen violence and souring suburban life, is not to be sniffed at. And electronic cut -and- pasters The Avalanches sampled Divine cooing, ‘Surely EXPULSION is not the answer!’ on their cult track *Frontier Psychiatrist.* You gotta love it, flammable synthetic fabrics and all.</p> <p>TRAILER<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrAkQ923Wk0\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrAkQ923Wk0</a></p> <p>SCHEDULE BREAKDOWN<br/>6:00 - Drinks upstairs at Genesis Cinema<br/>6.40 - Film</p> <p>ADDRESS AND DETAILS<br/>93-95 Mile End Rd<br/>London E1 4UJ</p> ",

Pretentious codswallop? Quite probably. For devotees, however, it is nonetheless compulsive viewing.

Usually we have two highly experienced guitarists, a drummer and two backing vocalists. Note that song options are likely to be confined to mainstream soul/blues, pop, rock &amp; RnB genres spanning mutiple music decades from contemporary to classics so there should be a song for everyone (as long as you don't steal one of mine!).</p> <p>This is a join event with another group so the number of RSVPs will be higher than what you see here. So limiting RSVPs because the place will be very busy and there will be limited slots for songs.

But let's not forget this will be a social so we'll have some much needed fun as well!</p> <p>It will be run in conjunction with my investing strategies group so total RSVPs is higher than what you see here. You can register at following link so stay updated on relevent events and see other RSVPs: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/investing-trading-macroeconomics-financial-markets/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/investing-trading-macroeconomics-financial-markets/</a></p> <p>**Some potential market impacting themes &amp; latest hot global political &amp; economic developments to ponder:**</p> <p>1. Central banks tightening and implications for global asset prices (stocks, currencies, crypto, commodities, bond yields, property) and outlook for inflation &amp; economic growth.<br/>2. Current valuations, risk of market crash and prolonged bear market for the major indices. The biggest \"everything bubble\" since 2000 finally began to unwind Q4 2021 with Nasdax down -30% &amp; some tech stocks down -90%. How more low could we go? A lot lower than people think.<br/>3. My proprietary indicators are forecating a global slowdown in earnings so I see fair value for stocks at much lower mutiples (PE) fulled partly by higher business costs whilst ponzinomics cryptos intrinsic value worth close to zero though - given high volatility - ok for short term trade but watch out below. Japan is now even more fucked with their failed 30 year QE experiment delivering a 50 year low valueless Yen. Is a FX mean reversion trade worth a punt? With the Euro near dollar parity is the failed EU project likely to follow suit soon?<br/>4. Geo political events including but not limited to Russian invasion, financial sanctions and spillovers to global markets and economies.<br/>5. As a US presidential candidate on the campaign trail once mocked the incumbent: \"it's the economy - stupid\". My leading indicators predicting major contraction if not outright global recession. Apart from the Bank of England, are the ECB/Fed in denial? The 3000+ Phd economists can't all be useless or maybe it's just Jay? Never get a lawyer whose decisions negatively effect billions globally to do a real man's job (what was congress/ president thinking appointing him and for that matter Yellen &amp; Bernanke who have never worked in the real world either).<br/>6. Market Sentiment &amp; Earnings. Spurred by their recency bias, it seems many who never invested in a pre GFC regime have been buying the dips. Beware of the high correlation between growth slowdown &amp; lower company earnings / misses (minus share buybacks). Yes sentiment/investor pyschology can matter short term but profitability ultimately drive prices, even extreme oversold signals on technicals can lose predictive value depending on market regime &amp; levels of risk aversion.<br/>7. Depth of policy tightening &amp; credibility reassertion. Economists pricing in rates to 3.5% along with QT. If inflation persists will a deep global recession be the price we have to pay? Many expect Fed pivot but with inflation forecasts nowhere near target &amp; unemployment well below level considered consisitent with price stability (NAIRU), why would they? This is not 2012 nor 2018 - the only thing that has pivoted is the economic paradigm with nearest parallels - UK/US/Europe in 70s/80s. Asset price mandate doesn't exist, the best empirical evidence shows long term growth suffers and the poor get even poorer. Don't Fight the Fed<br/>8. UK interest rate rises / monetary policy tightening and implications for house prices &amp; economy. Looks like we're heading into recession soon (or already in one). BOE's governer blaming everything from Ukraine to sunspot activity at the annoyance of the MPC hawks!<br/>9. Risks from new Covid variants and macro impact. What's going on with China lockdown of cities like Shanghai? Something not right - ulterior motives to cripple global economy &amp; further add to supply constraints to aid Putin's war? Who knows - as Philosopher Socrates once graciously said \"I know nothin\".

And if you want to know what a particular song lyrics was about/meaning - just ask. if I know I will tell you!</p> <p>The tour will end in Paul's local pub where we'll have a drink and maybe we'll all have a mini sing along though last time I did that we got thrown out being told firmly by the governer that it wasn't a Karoake pub! Haha</p> <p>In between stops at key monuments, we will walk at a medium to fast pace.

If you've ever attended those you'll know it's all a load of bollox mostly full of indiscriminate desperados that will get off with ANY one, NOT seeking to MEET the ONE!</p> <p>Yes generic social meetups can be a horrible soul destroying places devoid of attractive and successful high quaility people with depth &amp; genuine romantic intentions (often disguised as sex). That why we are teaming up with Socialite Connections &amp; sister groups to put on an anti-valentines neutral free event. This will not only discourage people turning up to explore coping off opportunities especially with vulnerable women feeling the pressure of superficial days like this. Tonight will just be a social but freindly event all centered around having fun highly engaging conversations and laughs over a drink or two.</p> <p>So if you think this day is a fake - and you're also looking for your 1 in 500,000 person rather than just someone and are not deluded enougth to think you'll meet them at a singles group or during the week of Feb 14 then tonight will be for you!! We recognise it's a workday after probably a heavy alcohol infused weekend so we're not proposing a party - just something light to fill your evening in case you don't want to be on your own or you just wanna get away from your partner for the night (we completely understand!)</p> <p>=====Venue &amp; Plan====<br/>On arrival, tell door security that the reservation is booked under Socialite Connections / Michelle &amp; Lucas. You will be directed to the VIP area. Free pizza will served at 9pm for everyone to share.</p> <p>This is a JOIN EVENT run in conjunction with other groups (led by Michelle) so the number of collective RSVPs/attendees is much higher then what you see on the list. This event will be fully hosted with very fun, outgoing &amp; entertaining socially skilled organisers - including myself - on site until the very end to introduce you and ignite stimulating conversations with other like minded people.</p> <p>Lucas The Hate Doctor</p> ",

        "description": "<p>In my absence, this walk will be led by Diana so please be sure to offer your support and gratitude. The 5.8 mile walk takes in some great views of the urban landscape, valleys and woodland to the north of the historic town of Berkhamsted. Wide, field-edge paths and woodland paths give plenty of space. A relatively easy style-free walk on level paths with about 10 gates and just two short uphill sections. We pass through the Alpine Meadow, the woodland of Frithsden beeches, along Berkhamsted golf course and then skirt around the castle. The walk will take in the historical sites of the World War I trenches and Berkhamsted Castle. There may be a short detour (time and weather permitting) to visit the Berkhamsted Castle visitor centre and learn a bit of history. After the walk we can select one of the many cafes in the town centre.</p> <p>The car park is accessed by Broadwater. Take Lower Kings Road over the canal, turn left into Broadwater and follow the windy road past Berkhamsted Football Club. Please note that there are no public toilets in the car park but it is possible to use the nearby Waitrose facilities. The walk should take 2.5 hours.</p> <p>Please note that this walk is not led by a qualified leader and, as such, isn't covered by insurance. Be sure to wear suitable boots and clothing. The organiser cannot be held responsible for any injuries, however caused. Members are expected to take responsibility for their own preparation and safety including adequate fluids, weather protection and a snack. Please be sure to make me aware if you have any medical conditions.</p> <p>Dogs are welcome as always but please be mindful to keep them on leads for roads and around other animals.</p> <p>If you are unable to attend please be sure to change your RSVP otherwise our departure will be delayed.</p> <p>This walk will go ahead with the recent advice by the government that groups of up to 30 are able to meet outdoors from 17th May.</p> <p>The threat from the virus is very low, especially outdoors, but it is still with us and we should still keep aware of the threat and take the usual precautions, such as considering your own health before attending and social distancing.</p> <p>It is essential that we continue to operate the walks in a covid-secure way so please only RSVP if you agree to the following:<br/>1. Only attend the walks if you have no symptoms or reason to believe you have been exposed to the virus<br/>2. Only attend the walks if you, or anyone you are a carer for, are not in the vulnerable category<br/>3. Greet people without physical contact<br/>4. Walk at a safe distance from others on the walk at least 2 meters apart.</p> <p>Track and trace requirements</p> <p>It is fairly easy for us to operate our own ‘track and trace’ system. If anyone develops symptoms within 2 days after a walk please contact the walk leader as soon as possible so he/she can put contact tracing into operation by alerting other members via Meetup messages. Having taken a Covid test, you should then contact the walk leader who can then inform others of the result.</p> ",

With a budget of $200 million, it sits right in the top bracket of the most expensive streaming productions ever made. And it shows, globetrotting through a series of incredible locations ranging from Prague to the Château de Chantilly in France. It’s a streamlined story with plenty of explosive action, all stemming from a battle of wills between its two central forces. Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans are on typically fine form here, providing a real mano a mano and representing two distinctly different versions of the CIA; in what it can be, and what it can do.<br/>Genuine, hard-hitting entertainment.</p> <p>Trailer:<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmllggGO4pM\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmllggGO4pM</a></p> <p>Parking in Berkhamsted is very difficult but there is road parking along Three Close Lane.

Brush maker Bob Bristle helped his friend, beer brewer Ben Barleyfield, to load barrels onto the back of a delivery cart. Once they had finished, Bob took off his new boots, which were becoming uncomfortable. Notorious for his forgetfulness, Bob went home without his boots and then completely forgot what he had done with them! He desperately needs your help to find them again before his wife realises they are missing. Desperate to avoid his wife's wrath, Bob has contacted the experts here at Treasure Hunt HQ. He's written down the information he remembers from their journey and has drawn us up a map of possible places they could be. We need you - our very best treasure hunters - to solve the Clues and track down the boots!</p> <p>Ready to strike gold?<br/>We need avid explorers to prove their amazing clue-solving skills. Your quest for the hidden treasure is above, your instructions are below. This is a real life self-guided adventure!</p> <p>Navigating your expedition<br/>Every sneaky clue you answer on your trail will be a name or number which matches a location on your treasure map. These are shown on the back page of your trail booklet (which you will be given on the day) and, once found, can be removed from your search. At the end of the trail, you should be left with one location. X marks the spot!</p> <p>If you can’t solve a tricky clue, phone the HQ on[masked].

        "description": "<p>A 5.6 miles circular pub walk from the Alford Arms in Frithsden, Hertfordshire. The Alford Arms has a wonderful philosophy of children, dogs and muddy boots welcome. You'll find a friendly atmosphere, good local ales, carefully chosen wines and delicious meals. The walking route passes the Buddhist monastery and St, John’s Church in Great Gaddesden and takes in the surrounding rolling hills of the Chilterns, with ancient lanes, pastures, woodlands and water meadows. There are lovely views throughout and the chance to see plenty of wildlife. The route includes several long and steady climbs and descents, plus a couple of steeper sections. The paths are firm in the main but can get muddy after rain or in winter and the water meadows (as the name suggests) can be quite marshy so good boots are a must. There are no stiles on route, just some kissing gates to negotiate. There are a couple of short sections of walking along the country lanes so take care of traffic at these points. Two of the fields you cross may be holding cattle and/or sheep so take care with dogs. Approximate time 2.5 hours.</p> <p>Parking is limited to a small car park and the roadside along the lane in front of the pub.</p> <p>Please note that this walk is not led by a qualified leader and, as such, isn't covered by insurance. Be sure to wear suitable boots and clothing. The organiser cannot be held responsible for any injuries, however caused. Members are expected to take responsibility for their own preparation and safety including adequate fluids, weather protection and a snack. Please be sure to make me aware if you have any medical conditions.</p> <p>Dogs are welcome as always but please be mindful to keep them on leads for roads and around other animals.</p> <p>If you are unable to attend please be sure to change your RSVP otherwise our departure will be delayed.
