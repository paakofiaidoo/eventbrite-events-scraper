Buckinghamshire is a county well known for its rivers, canals and landscape and of course the Chiltern Hills further North.</p> <p>Our hike covers a very scenic stretch of the River Thames taking us past the charming riverside villages of Aston and Hurley and also Marlow Lock, - built in 1773. Time seems to have stood still in this area and even the village of Hurley is little changed since the days when it was a Benedictine Monastery. We also get a glimpse of Bisham Abbey and Bisham Church across the River Thames before we cross over the weir footbridge at Hambleden Mill (61m wide and an experience in itself). After a short stop here, we follow an enchanting woodland trail passing meadows back to Marlow.</p> <p>The beauty and tranquillity of the area has attracted numerous famous residents including Mary Shelley (the author of \"Frankenstein\"), T.S.Eliot, Heston Blumenthal, Andrew Strauss and even Robbie Williams and David Seaman own properties there.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Paddington station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:57am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

For further details please check in the description below.</p> <p>Summit England's highest mountain - known as the “roof of England” with sublime views into some of the Lake District’s most famous valleys.</p> <p>Join us to discover why Wainwright determined this place as: “Mecca of all weary pilgrims in Lakeland, the place of many ceremonies and celebrations, of bonfires and birthday parties, the ultimate, the supreme, the one object above all others, the highest ground in England - the top of Scafell Pike”</p> <p>It's a serious hike, being tough and steep in places. Depending on weather the route can involve scrambling over rocky terrain and requires a good fitness level and previous experience of mountain hikes</p> <p>Trip Highlights</p> <p>• Approx 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Hike up one peak of the National Three Peaks Challenge - Scafell Pike</p> <p>• See the best of The Lake District - England's largest National park</p> <p>• Explore the famous glacial Langdale valley, described by John Ruskin as “…the loveliest rock scenery, chased with silver waterfalls, that I ever set foot or heart upon”</p> <p>• Visit Angle Tarn which according to Alfred Wainwright ranks amongst the best of Lakeland tarns with its indented shore and islets. We can come across red deer here</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man Col who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>Photos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips so are the actual views that you will see from the route that you'll be hiking</p> <p>Click here to join our Facebook community:<br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics</a></p> <p>Trip Description:</p> <p>This is a challenging hike to the summit of the highest mountain in England, Scafell Pike (978 m).</p> <p>The beginning of the hike goes through Cumbria Way, a long distance path which crosses the county from Ulverston in the south to Carlisle in the north.</p> <p>Then we continue with walking up Mickleden, a large glaciated valley in the shadow of a group of mountains and one of the two valleys called the Langdale Pikes which join to form Great Langdale, the other being Oxendale. Langdale is a U-shaped valley formed by glaciers, referred to by the poet Wordsworth as a “must visit valley”. Our route begins to climb up to the Rossett Pass alongside Rossett Gill via a series of wide zig-zags.</p> <p>There then follows a route past Angle Tarn (lake) and eventually, we will reach a cross shelter, built from stone in the famous Esk Hause Pass. It’s a high mountain pass from which we begin the final ascent to the summit of Scafell Pike which goes between Esk Pike and Great End, giving us time to admire the views down Eskdale, one of the Lake District’s most unspoilt valleys.</p> <p>From the top of the pass, a well-trodden route takes us up onto the high ridge of the Scafells. Once on the top we will spend some time exploring the rocky summit, the result of thousands of years of glaciation. On a clear day Scotland, the Isle of Man and even Ireland in the West can be seen.</p> <p>Transport &amp; Meeting Point</p> <p>We'll meet at the car park next to Sticklebarn Tavern at 8:45 and leave at 9am (be careful about correct car park; you may need £9 in coins).

        "description": "<p>A picturesque adventure through England's most wooded county with a variety of attractions from historic buildings, picture postcard rural rivers and even a Witches cave. A glorious circular hike from the ancient market town of Farnham steeped in history going back nearly 1000 years on this trail through time. One of the very first Outdooraholics hikes from all those years ago, but still a timeless classic.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Explore the romantic and enchanting ruins of an abandoned abbey dating back nearly 1000 years</p> <p>• Visit the famous and picture postcard Tilford village cricket green</p> <p>• See an 800 year old oak tree</p> <p>• Visit a cave where supposedly a White Witch lived (Mother Ludlam)</p> <p>• Explore the Bourne Woods and see where Gladiator and over 20 other films were set</p> <p>• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey through woodland paths</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Starting in the historic and attractive Georgian market town of Farnham, we go on a woodland valley trail via Mother Ludlam's cave (home to the White Witch of Waverley according to the legend), past Moor Park House, and then on to explore the site of Waverley Abbey ruins (founded 1128) and to see the grand Waverley Abbey House set on a lake. Our trail passes the famous cricket green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the River Wey and flanked by two medieval stone bridges and then onto the Bourne Woods.</p> <p>Tilford Green is a superb example of a traditional village green from a long gone era - with a cricket pitch, pub and two medieval stone bridges. We then head on to visit an 800 year old oak tree (8 metre girth) before making our way back to Farnham. We also pass a farm where we see pigs (and often baby piglets). The Bourne woods has an interesting mix of heathland and coniferous trees and its beauty has drawn filmmakers for films such as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Princess, War Horse and at least 20 others - we'll be hiking through the area where these were filmed.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Waterloo station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9am train.

It is also a beginners hike and we return to London earlier than usual, so it is ideal for people new to hiking or those who have plans for the evening. We finish in a picture postcard country pub for some well deserved refreshments.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike to the start of the famous Ridgeway Trail - Britain's oldest trail dating back at least 5000 years</p> <p>• Get views of the huge 147m white lion carved into the hillside at Whipsnade</p> <p>• Walk some fantastic hills in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</p> <p>• Visit the Bridgewater Monument - a 33m tall tower built in 1832 in memory of the third Duke of Bridgewater</p> <p>• Visit the tiny village of Aldbury - a picturesque setting often referred to as a ''chocolate-box'' village due to its traditional appearance</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike takes in both some stunning scenery and a good bit of history. We hike through beech woodland, chalk uplands and get some great views over the vale of Aldbury before leading back through the woods of the Ashridge Estate - the former home of the Dukes of Bridgewater. We then drop into the quaint and unspoilt village of Aldbury. Part of our route takes us along the ancient path of the famous Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britain's oldest road and we also pass the Bridgewater Monument - created to honour the Duke who built one of Britain's first canals.</p> <p>Ivinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\".</p> <p>For the attentive and sharp eyed a 483 foot long white lion carved into a distant chalk hill is also visible from the stunning panorama of Ivinghoe Beacon.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Euston station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:55am train.

        "description": "<p>We’re off to the North Downs in Surrey - an area so spectacular it’s been designated an official Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This hike starts at the charming historic town of Guildford which has a long and varied history dating back thousands of years to the Bronze Age and more recently to the castle that the Normans built 1000 years ago.</p> <p>Our hike reveals lush countryside, bright and open woodlands and follows the River Wey Canal - we go beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings for which Guildford is famed. We visit an enchanting ancient church nestling on St Martha’s Hill with breathtaking panoramic views almost as far as the sea. We then finish in Guildford to get a glimpse of this picture postcard town that’s just a 35 minute train journey from London.</p> <p>This hike was designed and written by one of our hike leaders who was born and lived in Guildford and we show you its undiscovered gems!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Explore the beautiful Surrey countryside Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</p> <p>• Admire the far reaching views of St Martha's hill with its historic church</p> <p>• Visit Guildford - Surrey's most significant ancient town with Bronze Age roots and see for yourself why it has attracted many famous residents.</p> <p>• Follow the tranquil River Wey as it gently flows past willow trees through rural Surrey</p> <p>• Visit the enchanting ruins of the 14th century St Catherine's Chapel - which attracted the artist Turner to paint it in 1807 and 1808</p> <p>• Hike along part of the North Downs Way - the 2nd most acclaimed long distance route in South East England</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Guildford is best known for being a picturesque and quaint market town near London, but the countryside has far more to offer than most visitors discover beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings. Famous past and current residents include Lewis Carroll - author of Alice in Wonderland, Jodie Kidd, Alan Turin, Terry Jones (the Monty Python writer) and Yvonne Arnaud. William Turner came to paint St Catherine's Church in 1707 and 1708 and his paintings now hang in the Tate Gallery.</p> <p>Once in Guildford we hike along the picturesque River Wey canal where the nestled boat houses sit on this tranquil waterway leading us to the ruin of St Catherine's church. We then hike into Bluebell Woods where we join the ancient North Downs Way path along a ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we come to the remote and isolated St Martha’s church built in the 12th century.</p> <p>From here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see seven counties from this point. We then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory built by the East India Company in 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now an enchanting derelict site covering 27 acres with much to see including relics, tramways and buildings from its nearly 400 year history.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Waterloo station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9am train.

Enjoying the smell of the sea and the fresh breeze we cross the channel by a ferry that has been a traditional attraction on these parts for centuries. Getting to the Roman village of West Itchenor our path continues down to the Chichester Marina with over 1000 boats.

Extra supplies can be kept in the vehicle and picked up as needed when we meet it. There won't be a fixed time for meals as we should all be constantly snacking on high energy/calorific foods to keep ourselves properly fuelled.

        "description": "<p>The beauty of Box Hill has inspired many great artists, writers and musicians for hundreds of years. Jane Austen based the picnic scene from ''Emma'' here, George Lambert's famous painting of Box Hill in 1733 (now in the Tate Gallery) and it's even had several songs written about it, the most recent being ''On Box Hill'' by Everything But the Girl. It also inspired the poet Keats and the writer G.K. Chesterton. Come and discover the magic of Box Hill for yourself and see why it’s attracted and inspired so many famous creatives for centuries.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike along the stunning Surrey Hills (422 km²) - a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which covers one quarter of the county of Surrey</p> <p>• See the famous Box Hill viewpoint with far reaching views over Surrey and Sussex</p> <p>• Enjoy breathtaking hiking through the woods and hills of the North Downs</p> <p>• Visit Denbies - England's largest vineyard, which has won international awards</p> <p>• See the twisting hill roads of the 2012 Olympics cycle race where the cyclists did 9 laps of this spectacular section</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Box Hill is located on the North Downs and lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

        "description": "<p>A picturesque adventure through England's most wooded county with a variety of attractions from historic buildings, picture postcard rural rivers and even a Witches cave. A glorious circular hike from the ancient market town of Farnham steeped in history going back nearly 1000 years on this trail through time. One of the very first Outdooraholics hikes from all those years ago, but still a timeless classic.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Explore the romantic and enchanting ruins of an abandoned abbey dating back nearly 1000 years</p> <p>• Visit the famous and picture postcard Tilford village cricket green</p> <p>• See an 800 year old oak tree</p> <p>• Visit a cave where supposedly a White Witch lived (Mother Ludlam)</p> <p>• Explore the Bourne Woods and see where Gladiator and over 20 other films were set</p> <p>• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey through woodland paths</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Starting in the historic and attractive Georgian market town of Farnham, we go on a woodland valley trail via Mother Ludlam's cave (home to the White Witch of Waverley according to the legend), past Moor Park House, and then on to explore the site of Waverley Abbey ruins (founded 1128) and to see the grand Waverley Abbey House set on a lake. Our trail passes the famous cricket green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the River Wey and flanked by two medieval stone bridges and then onto the Bourne Woods.</p> <p>Tilford Green is a superb example of a traditional village green from a long gone era - with a cricket pitch, pub and two medieval stone bridges. We then head on to visit an 800 year old oak tree (8 metre girth) before making our way back to Farnham. We also pass a farm where we see pigs (and often baby piglets). The Bourne woods has an interesting mix of heathland and coniferous trees and its beauty has drawn filmmakers for films such as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Princess, War Horse and at least 20 others - we'll be hiking through the area where these were filmed.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Waterloo station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9am train.

        "description": "<p>Trip FULL.</p> <p>Probably the most dreamed about and romanticised part of Britain - made famous through the writing of Daphne de Maurier with such great works as Rebecca and Jamaica Inn. We’re off to explore this magical country and also to visit Fowey - where she chose to live and found inspiration for her great novels.</p> <p>Cornwall’s unique history, rugged beauty and deep-blue ocean vistas await to be discovered on foot. With almost a third of Cornwall designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, we’ll be spoiled for choice when it comes to spectacular views and untouched nature. We’ve lined up some great hikes. Our first one is along a stunning stretch of Cornish coastline garnished with frozen in time fishing villages, high cliffs, dreamy sandy beaches and the beautiful Caerhays Castle with its lush 120-acre garden. And the second day is an exploration of Fowey and the surroundings - ride the ferry (twice) to discover brilliant views towards Fowey Harbour and the estuary and hike through the woods around the mystical Pont Pill.

Surrounded on three sides by the wild Atlantic ocean, it is almost like a geographic island. It has its own Celtic heritage and its own language - Kernowek, which is spoken by about 2000 people. 27% of the county is proclaimed an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty made up of 12 separate geological areas and covering 958 sq km. Cornwall contains some of Britain’s finest coastal scenery and is definitely a must-see destination.</p> <p>For accommodation, we're exclusively renting a secluded hostel just for our group in the picturesque hamlet of Boswinger. Boswinger is in the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The cottage we’re staying in is off the beaten track, surrounded by lush-green countryside and in walking distance from several beaches. An idyllic setting.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Thursday 7th July</p> <p>Head over to our exclusively booked hostel surrounded by peaceful countryside with a beautiful small beach at the bottom of the winding country road and several beaches at a walking distance. Idyllic location off the beaten track.</p> <p>Friday 8th July</p> <p>Saturday's hike: Boswinger circular<br/>Distance: 13 miles (21km)<br/>Ascent: 860m<br/>Grading: Intermediate, tough hills - click here for details: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a><br/>Hiking time: About 5 to 6 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>From our hostel we take a short walk to the coast and join the South West Coast Path. Our exploration follows a path running by Hemmick Beach and its secluded sands and rocky walls. We continue to the charming Vault Beach nestled within a curve and in few miles we find ourselves at Dodman Point - one of the highest headlands in the area (360ft). On a clear day you can see back as far as the Lizard Peninsula and as far forward as Rame Head - 99 miles of spectacular coast. The dramatic stretch of coast between Gorran Haven and Maenease Point contains splendid cliff scenery. The route then continues through the rocky coastal paths to Gorran Haven. Following the South West Coastal path, we will pass the village of Portmellon to pass Colona Beach and Great Perhaver Beach. We discover miles of sandy beaches, cliffs, coves and green pastures all garnished with the deep-blue waters of the Atlantic. We follow the coast to the charming village of Mevaggisey and then head inland back to the hostel.</p> <p>Saturday 9th July</p> <p>Sunday's hike: Fowey Circular<br/>Distance: 6 miles (9km)<br/>Ascent: 320m<br/>Grading: Beginners/Intermediate - click here for details: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a><br/>Hiking time: About 3 to 4 hours of actual hiking including ferries</p> <p>The “Hall Walk” is a Cornish classic - a hike with two ferry crossings to complete a circular route from Fowey to Bodinnick and Polruan with stunning views from each side of the water. Reaching Bodinnick with ferry, our route starts with a climb through Bodinnick to the start of the original Hall Walk. Our path runs high along the northern bank of Pont Creek through shady woods to reach the tiny hamlet of Pont and the lovely Pont Pill. Crossing the river at Pont we continue past an ancient church and then onto the South West Coast path for incredible ocean views. The route offers beautiful views of Fowey and the estuary and each corner gives a fresh perspective. Our footpath ends when we reach Polruan where we ferry cross back to Fowey.</p> <p>Sunday 10th July</p> <p>We shall visit the Eden project on the way back to London. The Eden project is an incredible collection of plants from around the world housed within the worlds largest green house and also has the worlds largest indoor rainforest. The figures are staggering - it cost £86 million pounds to build, houses an area the size of 30 football pitches and has 135,000 plants. There are two heat and humidity controlled biomes that grow such plants as banana trees, coffee, rubber, olives and even tea.</p> <p>We have made a group booking for entry which reduces it to £21 per person.

        "description": "<p>Hike designed for beginners!</p> <p>Woodland, attractive towns, castles, river trails and chalk hills. This hike has a bit of nearly everything. We're off to historic Arundel in Sussex and breaking with tradition we'll also have a brief stop mid hike at a delightful little pub on the banks of the river Arun for that irresistible sneaky river side pint to satisfy the Outdoor Alcoholics.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike the chalk hills with breathtaking views to the distant sea</p> <p>• Explore the landscaped Arundel Park with its woodland, Swanbourne lake, meadows and the Gothic Hiorne Tower</p> <p>• Superb views of the 12th century Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Follow the river Arun on a picturesque trail towards Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Visit the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral (French Gothic style)</p> <p>• Riverside pub visit</p> <p>• Visit the well preserved Sussex ancient market town of Arundel</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>A delightful mix of scenery with a good stretch along the river Arun, a visit to the woods and hills of Arundel Park and the striking and extravagant castellated Hiorne tower. We'll then venture into Arundel with its Gothic and enchanting castle dominating and looming over the town to finish our hike by finding the mighty Arundel Cathedral. We'll get some far off and ever nearing views of the castle as we follow the meandering and lazy river Arun. As well as the quick mid hike pub stop we'll have our usual refreshments in Arundel before making our way back to London. We'll pop up to hike past Arundel Cathedral but sadly can't get into the grounds or very close to Arundel Castle as admission is charged.</p> <p>With just under 2500 inhabitants Arundel is a small town, but has been home to the very rich and powerful Dukes of Norfolk for over 400 years. The original Mott and Bailey castle was built on the site in 1067 by the Normans after their invasion of Britain in 1066 and has since been rebuilt and expanded to provide the grand modern day stately home. The castle is still inhabited by the Dukes of Norfolk with the 18th Duke residing there currently. Hiorne Tower was built in Arundel Park in 1787 as an extravagant folly for the Duke of Norfolk and has a commanding position high on the hills and is quite enchanting and captivating.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:15am for the 9:20am train.

On the way there, we will hike along the elevated South Downs hills, summiting Ditchling Beacon to enjoy splendid sea views and diverse countryside, as the sea gets larger and larger and eventually we'll end up on the beach at Brighton.</p> <p>We will also have some time to explore Brighton itself - wander along the famous Lanes with the sound of the buskers livening up the streets, and lose ourselves in the bars, cafe's and independent jewellery and antique shops. You can even get a zip wire experience on the seafront. We will have some time to enjoy the pebble beach, and if you're feeling really in the seaside mood, grab some good old British Fish and Chips. Join us or miss out!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Traverse the chalk highlands of the South Downs<br/>• Summit Ditchling Beacon with far reaching views<br/>• Visit Stanmer, a charming ancient private village with medieval architecture<br/>• Explore the species-rich grassland of Whitehawk Hill<br/>• Finish at colourful Brighton and hit the beach, and for the brave - dip our toes in the sea<br/>• A great physical challenge for the fit and fast hikers</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This is a different experience from the usual walk along the South Downs ridge. Instead, this route starts off at Hassocks and then traverses north to south exploring hidden valleys, woods, open green expanses and parkland.</p> <p>The end point is the lively town of Brighton, famous for its vibrant nightlife, and we will be rewarded with a trip to the sea at Brighton Waterfront. Before that we will pass through the cosy village of Ditchling, then stand atop Ditchling Beacon, explore the green expanse of the Stanmer Park, pass Stanmer House, then walk through the University of Sussex campus to Falmer. We will enjoy a lovely view of the sea from Kemp Town Racecourse and then walk into the splendour that is Brighton. The boardwalk, pier, seafront bars, Mediterranean cuisine and fish and chips of England's most famous beach await you!</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:45am leaving the meeting point at 9am for the 9:15am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>The Yorkshire 3 Peaks is one of the most dramatic and tough hiking challenges the UK has to offer and Outdooraholics have been offering this hike several years now, it's been so popular we've even done it 3 days in a row! However, due to demand for something even tougher, we have now created the Yorkshire 5 Peaks! A hike that is exclusive to Outdooraholics and will only be run rarely due to it's extreme difficulty.</p> <p>The hike offers spectacular far reaching views and challenging rugged terrain and is set within the breath-taking Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route climbs a total of about 1650m of ascent with a few steep sections.</p> <p>This is the 2nd toughest and most challenging hike Outdooraholics do in the UK and is not for beginners! We suggest you only attempt this if you've already done the Yorkshire 3 Peaks or a similarly tough challenge</p> <p>For further details on this trip please see our Yorkshire 5 Peaks PDF - [LINK](<a href=\"https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire5Peaks.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire5Peaks.pdf</a>)</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Small group of 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Undertake this famous and formidable 50km hilly challenge</p> <p>• Build your own weekend trip around this day hike</p> <p>• Hike in the stunning Yorkshire Dales National Park - voted by Trip Advisor in 2021 the best National Park in Europe</p> <p>• Climb Whernside - the highest peak in the Yorkshire Dales at 736m</p> <p>• Enjoy spectacular views across the Yorkshire Dales National Park - on a clear day we can also see the Lake District and the sea</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>• The perfect challenge for yourself or great training for anyone doing big hikes like Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal</p> <p>You can also check in to the Yorkshire 5 Peaks Facebook page - [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireFivePeaks\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireFivePeaks</a>)</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>The five peaks to be climbed are Pen-y-ghent (694m), Whernside (736m), Plover Hill (680m), Simon Fell (650m) and Ingleborough (723m) with each peak offering a different degree of difficulty. We will do the most popular hike starting in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale and the hike is around 31 miles (50km) long with a total of about 1650m of ascent.</p> <p>We start with the ascent of Simon Fell before heading over to Ingleborough passing large areas of limestone rock before the path gets steeper and rockier as we reach the flat summit with its ancient fortifications and views across Morecambe Bay and on a clear day the Lake District. A steep descent eventually leads to the hamlet of Chapel le Dale and the gradual climb to the top of the second peak, Whernside (736m), the highest point in North Yorkshire. The route back down takes us alongside one of the wonders of the industrial revolution, Ribblehead viaduct (built in 1874, 400m wide and using 1.5 million bricks)! There now follows a long hike through fantastic limestone scenery before a steep climb up to the top of Plover Hill and then on to Pen y Ghent and then a quick drop down the front (with some easy scrambling) back to Horton. An ultimate challenge and also a superb hike.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Horton car park at 8am (20m south of BD24 0HF on B6479) and leave at 8am prompt - please buy a parking ticket to cover all day.

From sandy Mediterranean beaches to rugged snowcapped mountains, it offers a tranquil and diverse experience in nature. Charming with the simplicity of its countryside, the sounds of cowbells and the smiles of the friendly locals, Albania is the perfect place for the curious traveller.</p> <p>On our week long trip we go deep in the heart of the Albanian Alps also known as the Accursed Mountains due to their craggy tops, untamed terrain and breathtaking vistas. We admire their lyrical beauty and pass through deep green valleys and thick wild forests to visit places where traditions hold strong. We hike the most famous and tough part of the \"Peaks of the Balkan\" trail (Theth-Valbona) and also conquer one of the highest peaks in the area that lies on the border with Montenegro - The Pyramid. Our trails also lead us to deep narrow canyons, bright blue lakes with roaring waterfalls and two ancient castles dating back to Roman and Ottoman times. We enjoy a breathtaking ferry ride through a deep fjord admiring the crystal waters of the Komani Lake and the rugged mountain walls all around.</p> <p>Important Notes</p> <p>Although this trip is designed as a mixture of varied hiking and sightseeing, some of the hikes involve tough and long uphill/downhill sections and this trip is only suitable for hikers with experience of mountain hiking. Hiking boots ideally with ankle protection are essential due to the uneven and rocky terrain on some hikes.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Friday 1st July</p> <p>Pick up from Tirana airport and transfer to Shkoder. We stop to enjoy some lunch on the way before we continue our journey through the countryside to Shkoder - a capital during 300 BC and one of the oldest and largest towns in Albania. We also visit the ancient Rozafa Castle - rising imposingly on a rocky hill and guarded by rivers, the castle is steeped in legend and history predating Roman times with breath taking panoramic views.</p> <p>Saturday 2nd July</p> <p>Saturday's hike: The Field of Denelli<br/>Distance: 8 miles (12km)<br/>Ascent: approx 960m<br/>Descent: approx 960m, a steep downhill section<br/>Grading: Challenging/Mountain<br/>Hiking time: About 5 to 6 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>We are transferred to Theth National Park for our hike through the scenic Boga Valley.<br/>We hike the famous Field of Denelli trail that takes up the mountain to 1570m altitude and reveals breathtaking views.

This famous trail follows an ancient mule path linking two tribal regions.

We’ll experience Berber culture and Moroccan cuisine in Toubkal Mountain refuge before we hike to the summit. We then have time to explore Marrakech and stay in a centrally located basic hotel.</p> <p>The Toubkal adventure in the High Atlas starts from the Marrakech airport - we’ll be picked up and driven to Imlil village where our hike begins. Once our luggage is loaded on the mules, we begin the ascent to the Toubkal Mountain Refuge (3207m) where we’ll spend our first night high in the mountains. Next morning is the exhilarating climbing of Mt Toubkal followed by descent down to the refuge for lunch. After our meal we descend to Imlil and get a transfer to Marrakech for our hotel stay in the heart of the city. In the evening you’ll have some time on your hands for a stroll around central Marrakech and a bit of exploration.</p> <p>An exceptional long weekend packed with stunning landscapes, rich Moroccan culture and local cuisine.</p> <p>This location is so great that Sir Richard Branson has bought a villa here and we actually met him on the trails in October 2017.</p> <p>Important Notes</p> <p>Although it’s a short trip, these are very tough mountain hikes on steep paths with rocks and boulders for long sections and on the second day about 10 to 12 hours of solid hiking. There are also long ascents and descents. This is a trip only suitable for very fit and experienced hikers. This is our toughest hiking trip.</p> <p>Hiking boots with ankle protection are essential due to the rough, uneven and rocky terrain - you will have to climb over boulders and rocks. You should be prepared for early starts and late finishes, this trip is exhilarating but exhausting and is not for everyone.</p> <p>Altitude Warning</p> <p>Please note that we are hiking to a high altitude which affects everyone differently, you may get some mild signs of altitude sickness. We are spending our first night at the Neltner Refuge which is at 3207m and will help with acclimatisation. The following day we hike to the summit (approx 1000m ascent) and on reaching the summit we will usually descend within about 15 to 30 minutes. There are tablets available that you can buy in advance to help reduce or eliminate the effects of altitude sickness - we cannot advise on this but please see your doctor for details. Should you experience signs of Acute Mountain Sickness like headaches, nausea, dizziness or breathing difficulties, you should consult your guide immediately and you may need to descend back to the Mountain Hut, although this is rare.</p> <p>\\*Please note that your luggage while hiking will be transferred by mules. Therefore, there is a luggage limit of 15kg per person, but about 10kg should be aimed for and please pack into a large rucksack (no suitcases or hard bags please).</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Friday 1st July</p> <p>Friday's hike: Imlil to Toubkal (Neltner) Refuge<br/>Distance: 8 miles (approx 12km)<br/>Ascent: Approx 1500m<br/>Grading: Tough - Mountain - tough and long hike: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a><br/>Hiking time: About 5-6 hours of hiking</p> <p>Our private transfer will pick us up from Marrakech Menara Airport and take us to the village of Imlil. At Imlil we’ll load our luggage on the mules and start our hike having lunch about 1 hour in. Rising through the secluded Atlas mountains and through several picturesque passes, we will reach the small traditional Mountain Refuge under the top of Mt Toubkal - Neltner Refuge (3207m), where we will spend the night. Please note: The Refuge is a mountain hut and is basic accommodation in large mixed gender dormitories with bunk beds. Food here is very simple.</p> <p>Saturday 2nd July</p> <p>Saturday's hike: Toubkal (Neltner) Refuge - Mt Toubkal - Imlil<br/>Distance: 13 miles (approx 21km)<br/>Ascent: Approx 1000m<br/>Descent: 2468m<br/>Grading: Tough - Mountain - very steep hike scrambling over rocks and boulders in places: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a><br/>Hiking time: About 10 to 12 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>Today we make the ascent of Mt Toubkal (4167m). We wake at about 3:00am and after a quick breakfast we start our ascent in dark aiming to hit the summit to see sunrise, which depends on the group pace. Passing boulders and accompanied by magnificent views of several peaks, in 3 to 4 hours of walking we arrive at the distinctive metal tripod which marks the summit. The summit rewards with spectacular views on every side - we’ll see incredible high Atlas peaks and admire stunning views of the Atlas range along with far-reaching views towards the Sahara Desert - truly memorable sights.</p> <p>Descending Toubkal, we come down to the Refuge for lunch and then to Imlil, where we get a transfer back to Marrakech for our hotel stay and an evening to explore Marrakech. Please note, the hotel in Marrakech is a basic but well located guest house. Please don't expect Western Europe Hotel standards.</p> <p>Sunday 3rd July</p> <p>Our long weekend trip ends after breakfast. Should you want to stay more days, feel free to arrange these for yourself. You could also book a later flight in the evening to spend another day in Marrakech.

        "description": "<p>A picturesque hiking trail through the Chilterns Hills - an officially designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p> <p>This is a great hike towards the prominent beauty spot of Ivinghoe Beacon with some superb far reaching views. It is also a beginners hike and we return to London earlier than usual, so it is ideal for people new to hiking or those who have plans for the evening. We finish in a picture postcard country pub for some well deserved refreshments.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike to the start of the famous Ridgeway Trail - Britain's oldest trail dating back at least 5000 years</p> <p>• Get views of the huge 147m white lion carved into the hillside at Whipsnade</p> <p>• Walk some fantastic hills in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</p> <p>• Visit the Bridgewater Monument - a 33m tall tower built in 1832 in memory of the third Duke of Bridgewater</p> <p>• Visit the tiny village of Aldbury - a picturesque setting often referred to as a ''chocolate-box'' village due to its traditional appearance</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike takes in both some stunning scenery and a good bit of history. We hike through beech woodland, chalk uplands and get some great views over the vale of Aldbury before leading back through the woods of the Ashridge Estate - the former home of the Dukes of Bridgewater. We then drop into the quaint and unspoilt village of Aldbury. Part of our route takes us along the ancient path of the famous Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britain's oldest road and we also pass the Bridgewater Monument - created to honour the Duke who built one of Britain's first canals.</p> <p>Ivinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\".</p> <p>For the attentive and sharp eyed a 483 foot long white lion carved into a distant chalk hill is also visible from the stunning panorama of Ivinghoe Beacon.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Euston station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:55am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>Welcome to one of the most popular hiking areas in the heart of the Lake District - The Langdale Valley! This natural beauty has attracted many artists and writers through the centuries.</p> <p>This is an extended version of the classic Langdale Pikes which not only takes in the traditional five summits of The Pikes themselves (Pavey Ark, Harrison Stickle, Thurnacar Knott, Loft Crag and Pike of Stickle), but also four other Wainwrights on the way to them - Silver How, Blea Rigg, Sergeant Man, High Raise. Altogether a total of nine Wainwright fells are covered in this fabulous circular hike.</p> <p>Summit not 5, but 9 challenging peaks including High Raise - the highest mountain in the Central Fells with majestic mountain scenery. Enjoy the outstanding beauty of this fantastic valley, secluded tarns, waterfalls, rocky summits and panoramic views across the Lake District.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Approx 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Complete one of the best hikes in the Lake District</p> <p>• Climb up the highest mountain in the Central Fells and top of the iconic Langdale Pikes - High Raise 762m</p> <p>• Hike up the 8 accompanying dramatic Wainwright summits including - Silver How (395m), Blea Rigg (530m), Sergeant Man (720m), Thunacar Knott (723m), Pavey Ark (700m), Harrison Stickle (736m), Pike O’Stickle (709m) and Loft Crag (682m)</p> <p>• Enjoy the panoramic views across the Lake District’s fells, mountains, the lakes of Windermere, Grasmere and Rydal water</p> <p>• Start from the picturesque Elterwater - Centre of the Lakeland slate industry</p> <p>• Hike guided by Col - a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man</p> <p>• Build your own weekend trip around this day and rent a cottage with your friends!</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>The hike starts from the little hamlet of Elterwater with its lake of the same name. This great base for hikes in the Lakeland once was a centre for charcoal burning and home to an explosives factory between the Napoleonic Wars. Lake Elterwater being the smallest of the sixteen lakes in the valley derives from the old Norse for “Lake of the Swans”. Here you can come across whooper swans from Scandinavia and Siberia.</p> <p>The Langdale Pikes are one of the many highlights in Great Langdale. This lovely valley is associated with the great author William Wordsworth to whom it owes its high popularity. He wrote about Blea Tarn in his poem “The Excursion” and Dungeon Ghyll Force in “The Idle-Shepherd Boys”. He also referred to it in one text as a “must visit” valley.</p> <p>Great Langdale’s easily recognised summits come into view as you enter the valley from Ambleside, from Skelwith Bridge and Elterwater. We head up on to a ridge and start ticking off the summits as the hike initially follows well-trod paths and starting with Silver How 395 m, following Blea Rigg 530m and Sergeant Man 720m to High Raise 762m which possibly has the best 360 degree view in the Lake District (panoramic views to Skiddaw, Helvellyn and the Scafells) and which makes you feel standing on the top of the world.</p> <p>Those are the four summits en route and then on the way back we tackle Thunacar Knott 723m, Pavey Ark 700m (across Stickle tarn), Harrison Stickle 736m, Pike O’Stickle 709m and Loft Crag 682m. From the Stickle’s the route keeps following a clear path with slight descent, steep and rocky at times, to the bottom from where we will leave in more views of the peaks behind.</p> <p>We continue down a mountain path enjoying the spectacular views to the valley bottom below passing series of waterfalls and by Dungeon Ghyll Force (40 ft) - this iconic place Wordsworth wrote in his poem about: “It was a spot which you may see If ever you to Langdale go; Into a chasm a mighty block Hath fallen, and made a bridge of rock: The gulf is deep below; And, in a basin black and small, Receives a lofty waterfall\".<br/>Then we hike back through the valley on the Cumbria Way to Elterwater via the village of Chapel Stile. Watch out for red squirrels in the woodland.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at National Trust car park in Elterwater at 8:45, and leave at 9am. You may need £10 in coins. Please be on site on time as the group can not wait for everyone who is late. Estimated returning time - around 6:30 - 7pm.</p> <p>Map of meeting point: [LINK](<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/vjbPhLVQCrbYk2Cn9\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/vjbPhLVQCrbYk2Cn9</a>)</p> <p>You will need transport to and from the start of this hike, which is outside London.

        "description": "<p>Trip FULL.</p> <p>Are you ready to escape with us on this short weekend adventure to the mesmerizing Triglav National Park, hike upto Triglav summit with professional Slovenian mountain guides doing via ferrata on the way?</p> <p>Welcome to the captivating Julian Alps where we embark upon an unforgettable adventure to summit Slovenia’s highest peak - the mighty Mount Triglav (2864m). The locals claim that one is considered ‘’a true Slovenian’’ only after they have reached the peak at least once in their lifetime. You may not need to become ‘’a true Slovenian’’ but Mount Triglav is definitely worth being crossed from your bucket list as is seeing the iconic Lake Bled, which we stay nearby.</p> <p>ONLY 1 DAY OFF WORK REQUIRED - This trip is designed as a short break, perfect for fit adventurers who are keen to challenge themselves and feel the via ferrata thrill.</p> <p>Trip Highlights:</p> <p>• Climb the highest peak and symbol of Slovenia, Mount Triglav - considered a rite of passage for locals</p> <p>• Explore Triglav National Park - the only National Park in Slovenia and one of the oldest in Europe</p> <p>• Spend a night in a Mountain Hut on our journey to the summit</p> <p>• Enjoy the naturally wild and untamed nature of the Julian Alps</p> <p>• Bask on the fairytale shores and deep blue waters of the glacial Lake Bled</p> <p>• Visit Bled medieval Castle - the oldest castle in Slovenia and symbol of Bled</p> <p>• Short trip easy to be extended, should you want to stay in Bled extra days</p> <p>Photos - Most photos were taken by our guides on the trip</p> <p>Click here to join our Facebook community: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/</a></p> <p>Holiday Description</p> <p>Welcome to Slovenia - the first officially Certified Green country in the world and a not so hidden gem anymore but actually a very popular destination among tourists and more specifically among hikers wanting to conquer the epic Mount Triglav - the highest peak in the Julian Alps.</p> <p>Our journey starts from Ljubljana airport from where we will be taken by a private transfer to our accommodation in the picturesque town of Bled. Then, we will meet our hosts, check-in and have the rest of the day free to explore Bled. Do not miss out on the opportunity to visit the famous glacier Lake Bled - despite being Slovenia’s star tourist attraction, it remains unspoiled with crystal blue waters and a delightfully peaceful atmosphere. While there, do not forget the mighty Bled Castle which has been firmly standing at the top of 130 meters high steep cliff for over thousand years. Considered the oldest castles in the area, nowadays Lake Bled Castle is the most visited tourist gem that offers beautiful views of the lake and its small island, the Alpine town and the surrounding landscape with the peaks of the Julian Alps.</p> <p>On the next two days, our adventure continues. We head off to the starting point of our hike - Krma Valley and from there towards our main destination - Mount Triglav. We will go through gentle paths, thick forests and green meadows while keeping our eyes open for the huge variety of wildlife that calls this area home, including griffon vultures, golden eagles and lynx. In the afternoon, we will reach Kredarica hut where we will spend the night and gather strength for the last challenge - the last 350m via ferrata route which will finally bring us on the top of Slovenia.</p> <p>Important Notes</p> <p>The hike is tough and a challenging activity with a demanding climb to the summit of the mountain. It also requires a high level of endurance and can be challenging for those, who are not used to longer hikes. The climb to the summit of Mt. Triglav is via ferrata, which is an extremely steep climb on steel ladders and steel wires and is not recommended for people, who are not in a good physical condition or are afraid of heights. You need to be of above average fitness for this trip and a regular hiker, used to tough mountains. If you have any doubts, please email us before signing up.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Friday 24th June</p> <p>Our private transfer will pick you up from Ljubljana Airport and take you to your lovely accommodation in Bled.

As you progress through the thick and lush forests, do not forget to turn around and enjoy the unreal views that open up behind you. In the afternoon, you will arrive at Slovenia's highest mountain hut - Kredarica. You will have time to take a breath, relax with a hot beverage and beautiful scenery and prepare for the next challenging day.</p> <p>Sunday 26th June</p> <p>Hike: Climb Mt Triglav and descent to the valley<br/>Ascent/Descent: 350m/1,980m<br/>Grading: Challenging - click here for details<br/>Hiking time: About 4 to 6 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>Today is time for climb!

Romania is a country veiled in mystery and spooky vampire legends, rich folklore traditions and broad dramatic landscapes, which guarantee a thrilling adventure and memories to cherish for a lifetime. Being home to almost half of the population of large carnivores on the continent and having a large expanse of lush virgin forests, Romania is a popular choice for the hiker who wants a truly wild nature experience and Romania also has the largest virgin woodlands left in Europe.</p> <p>The country has had a turbulent past with the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the resistance led by Vlad the Impaler (who was the basis of the legend of Bram Stoker's Count Dracula).</p> <p>We’ve planned two nights in the town of Brasov which is nestled right at the base of the Carpathian Mountains and is famous for having the narrowest street in Europe. Founded in the 12th century and layered with history, its pastel-coloured buildings, cosy buzzing square and baroque ambience are only a part of the town’s charm.</p> <p>On Saturday we will have a full day of hiking the Piatra Craiului Mountain, reaching a high altitude to enjoy the awe inspiring vistas over Transylvania and its rugged scenery. Often compared to a dinosaur’s back, the sharp ridge of the mountain is a fascinating sight. On our way we will pass through the towering walls of the Zarnesti Gorge and its curious karst formations. It’s no wonder the Gorge is a popular film set location with its wild and picturesque beauty.</p> <p>On Sunday we will visit the famous Peles Castle. Hidden in a dense forest, this spectacular building is a glorious combination of medieval architecture and world cultures having over 160 rooms lavishly furnished and decorated to the slightest intricate detail.</p> <p>We will also have a shorter, scenic hike reaching the most popular natural monuments in the country - the \"Old Ladies\" and the \"Sphinx\" rocks. The unique and curious rock formations are veiled in mystery and are believed to be naturally formed by the wind.</p> <p>We finish our trip with a night in the capital - Bucharest, home to the world's 2nd largest administrative building. The city’s turbulent communist past and modern day identity offer a unique peek at Romanian culture and history and its well preserved Old Town.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Friday 24th June</p> <p>Pick up and transfer from Bucharest Airport to the medieval town of Brasov, the region’s cultural and economic centre nestled in the beautiful Transylvanian Alps. We will be spending the next two nights in the most visited town in Romania, famous for its amazing views of the surrounding mountains, the fresh cool air and fascinating historical heritage.</p> <p>We will stay at a lovely central hotel close to the main square where we will have plenty of options to try the local cuisine and enjoy the distinctive atmosphere of the narrow cobbled streets and gothic buildings, all marked by the curious past of the country.</p> <p>Saturday 25th June</p> <p>Saturday’s hike: Piatra Craiului Mountain<br/>Distance: 9/10 miles (14/16km)<br/>Ascent: 800/1000m<br/>Grading: Mountain<br/>Hiking time: About 7 to 8 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>After a short transfer to Zarnesti town we will head for a full day of hiking in the Piatra Craiului Mountain - considered the most beautiful and picturesque out of the Transylvanian Alps. We will be squeezing through the majestic 200m high stone walls of the legendary limestone Zarnesti Gorge, a popular film location chosen for its dramatic fairy tale-like scenery. We will reach a typical Romanian mountain hut before continuing for the most challenging part of the hike. Reaching an elevation of over 1800m will award us with far reaching vistas over mystical Transylvania.</p> <p>Sunday 26th June</p> <p>Sunday’s hike: Bucegi Mountain - Babele and Sphinx rocks<br/>Distance: 3/4 miles (6/7km)<br/>Grading: Beginners/Intermediate<br/>Hiking time: About 3 to 4 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>The fascinating royal residence Peles Castle awaits us. Nestled at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in the picturesque town of Sinaia, it is one of the most stunning castles in Europe. With over 160 rooms, the castle’s gorgeous interiors are a true wonder. Many rooms have dedicated themes from all over the world, the most famous being the Great Armoury Room with over 4000 pieces of some of the finest collections of arms and armoury.</p> <p>After this inspiring visit we will have a shorter and easier hike in one of the most popular parts of the Carpathian Mountains - the Bucegi Mountain. We will reach the extraordinary rock formations at its top which spark the imagination of thousands of visitors each year. Located at over 2000 metres above sea level the \"Old Ladies\" and the \"Sphinx\", which resembles a human head and the famous Egyptian statue, amaze with their curious shapes and mysterious origin.</p> <p>After the hike we will be transferred back to the capital Bucharest for the night where you will have free time for sightseeing. The city is famous for its vibrant Old Town district which is a fun mixture of local culture, history and entertainment. With its charming French-Italian vibe and grand buildings, it’s a buzzing area that seems to never sleep. This is where the guided trip ends.</p> <p>Monday 27th June</p> <p>After breakfast you will have some more time to explore Bucharest self guided, then make your way by bus or taxi to the airport for the flight back home. Please note that Uber currently operates in Bucharest as well. You may of course choose to stay an extra night to give you time to explore Bucharest fully.</p> <p>Discussion: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53470776/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53470776/</a></p> <p>Cost and Payment</p> <p>The trip is £363 per person.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for a gorgeous hike across the chalk ridge of the South Downs hills on a route from Hassocks to Lewes. We are travelling so far from London, we are able to see the coast from parts of this hike.</p> <p>If you enjoy rolling hills, panoramic views stretching to the sea, rivers, windmills, Iron Age hill forts, and picturesque trails through beautiful rural Sussex, you have just found the perfect hike. We triumphantly finish our hike by passing through the striking gateway of Lewes Castle as we enter the ancient market town. To complete the day, we visit a pub for our usual end of hike refreshments.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Enjoy a superb elevated ridge hike with far reaching panoramic views</p> <p>• See the 200 year old Clayton windmills Jack and Jill</p> <p>• Conquer Ditchling Beacon (248m) - the third highest point in south east England that was the site of an Iron Age hill fort</p> <p>• Visit the ancient and well preserved market town of Lewes</p> <p>• Hike through the Castle Gate in Lewes - the castle originally built by William the Conqueror in 1069 after his invasion of Britain</p> <p>• Hike in the South Downs - one of the best National Parks in the south of England</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Our route takes us up onto the South Downs ridge past Jack and Jill - two well preserved windmills. Jack is the only \"male\" windmill in the UK (all others being considered female) and Jill was originally built in Brighton and moved by a team of horses and oxen and is still used to grind corn. Step by step we reach a dramatic panoramic view stretching to the English Channel, with Brighton perching gently in the foreground on the coast.</p> <p>Our adventure continues further along the northern edge of the South Downs with superb views inland until we reach Ditchling Beacon. The latter was the site of an Iron Age hill fort and is the third highest point in the South East of England at 248m and consequently has fabulous views across the Weald up to the North Downs Way. It was also the location of one of the Beacons that warned of the Spanish Armada in 1588. After a couple more peaks we drop down to follow the River Ouse into Lewes. We are welcomed into the old part of the town by a dramatic hike through the Castle Gate - the castle originally built by William the Conqueror in 1069 after his invasion of Britain.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9:02am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:46am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us on this spectacular trail which takes us across three hills following the South Downs Way. We also cross lush river valleys in one of our most spectacular and dramatic day hikes. Much of this landscape was formed by glaciers in the last ice age.</p> <p>We'll get superb far reaching panoramic views as far as the sea from the elevated ridges we hike on for much of the day and also the chance to hike along the unique white chalk paths of the South Downs National Park. After the hike we'll return back to the attractive and ancient market town of Lewes.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Spectacular elevated hike on the high ridges of the South Downs</p> <p>• Distant coastal views including of the Seven Sisters cliffs</p> <p>• Visit a 2500 year old Iron Age Hill Fort</p> <p>• Cross the Greenwich Meridian line separating the Eastern and Western Hemispheres</p> <p>• Hike through dramatic Glacial “dry valleys”</p> <p>• Hike part of the famous South Downs Way</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We'll start off in the historic town of Lewes which is a well preserved Sussex market town dating back to the 6th century. We're soon out on our rural trail that leads us into the rich tapestry of green landscapes, tranquility and breathtaking views of the area. Crossing the river Ouse and its beautiful valley, we make headway into the South Downs, going further into Britain’s newest National Park. Along our hike over several hills and summits, we visit Mount Caburn which was the site of an Iron Age hill fort dating back to 400 BC along with 140 burial pits with a few ditches still remaining. We also pass by the village of Rodmell where Virginia Woolf lived nearby in Monk's House and we cross the footbridge of River Ouse, where her lifetime story ended abruptly.</p> <p>The chalk composition and heavy sheep grazing in the area results in a relatively barren and stark landscape in places which has its own unique beauty. We join part of the famous South Down Way which is the first bridleway National Trail. Our trail rewards us with a good few reminders of how near to the coast we are here with good views of the Channel on a clear day and to stretch our eyes as far as the legendary Seven Sisters coastal cliffs.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

        "description": "<p>We’re off to explore a stunning and ancient bit of the Kent countryside connected with two historical figures - Sir Winston Churchill and also the social activist and co-founder of the National Trust - Octavia Hill. Both of these giant figures had a lifelong love of the outdoors and we’re going to show you why with this fantastic hike through a gorgeous part of Kent (known as the \"Garden of England\").</p> <p>We pass near by Churchill’s family home along with other historical estates such as Emmetts Garden and Tenchleys Manor. Our trail takes us through several charming villages including Crockham Hill where Octavia Hill lived and we also visit Toys Hill (235m) which has far reaching views and the site of a former vast mansion with a few reminders it was here remaining.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Visit the charming town of Oxted</p> <p>• Pass the historical Country Houses of Tenchleys Manor and Emmetts Garden</p> <p>• Pass the home of Sir Winston Churchill - Chartwell</p> <p>• Hike through Crockham Hill - the village where Octavia Hill lived and is buried</p> <p>• Visit Toys Hill - the place which inspired Octavia Hill to found the National Trust</p> <p>• Enjoy the countryside and rural beauty of Limpsfield Common and Westerham</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We start off in Oxted, a small town with pretty timber framed buildings, where the Greenwich meridian passes through the local school. From there we continue on to the Greensand Way, which goes across grassy meadows and leads to Limpsfield Common and the historic Tenchleys Manor built in 1599. We then continue onto Crockham Hill - home to Octavia Hill where she chose to be buried. Much of the land in the area was acquired for the National Trust through Octavia's efforts.</p> <p>From the village we progress onto Chartwell to see the splendid adulthood home and garden of Sir Winston Churchill and after a short rest we move on to see the charming Chartwell farm. Following the picturesque views across the weald on Puddledock Lane, we continue on to Toys Hill (235m) - a hamlet situated on the steep scarp slope of the Greensand Ridge which inspired Octavia Hill to create the National Trust. After admiring the views from Toys Hill, we hike to Emmetts Garden - an Edwardian estate located on Ide Hill and from there we return back to Oxted passing the quaint village of Westerham.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:20am leaving the meeting point at 8:35am for the 8:50am train.

        "description": "<p>Please note, this trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination. For further details please check in the description below.</p> <p>The Yorkshire 3 Peaks is one of the most dramatic and tough hiking challenges the UK has to offer and Outdooraholics have been offering this hike several years now, it's been so popular we've even done it 3 days in a row! However, due to demand for something even tougher, we have now created the Yorkshire 5 Peaks! A hike that is exclusive to Outdooraholics and will only be run rarely due to it's extreme difficulty.</p> <p>The hike offers spectacular far reaching views and challenging rugged terrain and is set within the breath-taking Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route climbs a total of about 1650m of ascent with a few steep sections.</p> <p>This is the 2nd toughest and most challenging hike Outdooraholics do in the UK and is not for beginners! We suggest you only attempt this if you've already done the Yorkshire 3 Peaks or a similarly tough challenge</p> <p>For further details on this trip please see our Yorkshire 5 Peaks PDF: <a href=\"https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire5Peaks.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire5Peaks.pdf</a></p> <p>Trip Highlights:</p> <p>• Small group of 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Undertake this famous and formidable 50km hilly challenge</p> <p>• Build your own weekend trip around this day hike</p> <p>• Hike in the stunning Yorkshire Dales National Park - voted by Trip Advisor in 2021 the best National Park in Europe</p> <p>• Climb Whernside - the highest peak in the Yorkshire Dales at 736m</p> <p>• Enjoy spectacular views across the Yorkshire Dales National Park - on a clear day we can also see the Lake District and the sea</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>• The perfect challenge for yourself or great training for anyone doing big hikes like Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal</p> <p>Photos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips so are the actual views that you will see from the route that you'll be hiking</p> <p>Click here to join our Facebook community:<br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics</a></p> <p>You can also check in to the Yorkshire 5 Peaks Facebook page:<br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireFivePeaks\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireFivePeaks</a></p> <p>Hike Description</p> <p>The five peaks to be climbed are Pen-y-ghent (694m), Whernside (736m), Plover Hill (680m), Simon Fell (650m) and Ingleborough (723m) with each peak offering a different degree of difficulty. We will do the most popular hike starting in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale and the hike is around 31 miles (50km) long with a total of about 1650m of ascent.</p> <p>We start with the ascent of Simon Fell before heading over to Ingleborough passing large areas of limestone rock before the path gets steeper and rockier as we reach the flat summit with its ancient fortifications and views across Morecambe Bay and on a clear day the Lake District. A steep descent eventually leads to the hamlet of Chapel le Dale and the gradual climb to the top of the second peak, Whernside (736m), the highest point in North Yorkshire. The route back down takes us alongside one of the wonders of the industrial revolution, Ribblehead viaduct (built in 1874, 400m wide and using 1.5 million bricks)! There now follows a long hike through fantastic limestone scenery before a steep climb up to the top of Plover Hill and then on to Pen y Ghent and then a quick drop down the front (with some easy scrambling) back to Horton.

Romania is a country veiled in mystery and spooky vampire legends, rich folklore traditions and broad dramatic landscapes, which guarantee a thrilling adventure and memories to cherish for a lifetime. Being home to almost half of the population of large carnivores on the continent and having a large expanse of lush virgin forests, Romania is a popular choice for the hiker who wants a truly wild nature experience and Romania also has the largest virgin woodlands left in Europe.</p> <p>The country has had a turbulent past with the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the resistance led by Vlad the Impaler (who was the basis of the legend of Bram Stoker's Count Dracula).</p> <p>We’ve planned two nights in the town of Brasov which is nestled right at the base of the Carpathian Mountains and is famous for having the narrowest street in Europe. Founded in the 12th century and layered with history, its pastel-coloured buildings, cosy buzzing square and baroque ambience are only a part of the town’s charm.</p> <p>On Saturday we will have a full day of hiking the Piatra Craiului Mountain, reaching a high altitude to enjoy the awe inspiring vistas over Transylvania and its rugged scenery. Often compared to a dinosaur’s back, the sharp ridge of the mountain is a fascinating sight. On our way we will pass through the towering walls of the Zarnesti Gorge and its curious karst formations. It’s no wonder the Gorge is a popular film set location with its wild and picturesque beauty.</p> <p>On Sunday we will visit the famous Peles Castle. Hidden in a dense forest, this spectacular building is a glorious combination of medieval architecture and world cultures having over 160 rooms lavishly furnished and decorated to the slightest intricate detail.</p> <p>We will also have a shorter, scenic hike reaching the most popular natural monuments in the country - the \"Old Ladies\" and the \"Sphinx\" rocks. The unique and curious rock formations are veiled in mystery and are believed to be naturally formed by the wind.</p> <p>We finish our trip with a night in the capital - Bucharest, home to the world's 2nd largest administrative building. The city’s turbulent communist past and modern day identity offer a unique peek at Romanian culture and history and its well preserved Old Town.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Friday 17th June</p> <p>Pick up and transfer from Bucharest Airport to the medieval town of Brasov, the region’s cultural and economic centre nestled in the beautiful Transylvanian Alps. We will be spending the next two nights in the most visited town in Romania, famous for its amazing views of the surrounding mountains, the fresh cool air and fascinating historical heritage.</p> <p>We will stay at a lovely central hotel close to the main square where we will have plenty of options to try the local cuisine and enjoy the distinctive atmosphere of the narrow cobbled streets and gothic buildings, all marked by the curious past of the country.</p> <p>Saturday 18th June</p> <p>Saturday’s hike: Piatra Craiului Mountain<br/>Distance: 9/10 miles (14/16km)<br/>Ascent: 800/1000m<br/>Grading: Mountain<br/>Hiking time: About 7 to 8 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>After a short transfer to Zarnesti town we will head for a full day of hiking in the Piatra Craiului Mountain - considered the most beautiful and picturesque out of the Transylvanian Alps. We will be squeezing through the majestic 200m high stone walls of the legendary limestone Zarnesti Gorge, a popular film location chosen for its dramatic fairy tale-like scenery. We will reach a typical Romanian mountain hut before continuing for the most challenging part of the hike. Reaching an elevation of over 1800m will award us with far reaching vistas over mystical Transylvania.</p> <p>Sunday 19th June</p> <p>Sunday’s hike: Bucegi Mountain - Babele and Sphinx rocks<br/>Distance: 3/4 miles (6/7km)<br/>Grading: Beginners/Intermediate<br/>Hiking time: About 3 to 4 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>The fascinating royal residence Peles Castle awaits us. Nestled at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains in the picturesque town of Sinaia, it is one of the most stunning castles in Europe. With over 160 rooms, the castle’s gorgeous interiors are a true wonder. Many rooms have dedicated themes from all over the world, the most famous being the Great Armoury Room with over 4000 pieces of some of the finest collections of arms and armoury.</p> <p>After this inspiring visit we will have a shorter and easier hike in one of the most popular parts of the Carpathian Mountains - the Bucegi Mountain. We will reach the extraordinary rock formations at its top which spark the imagination of thousands of visitors each year. Located at over 2000 metres above sea level the \"Old Ladies\" and the \"Sphinx\", which resembles a human head and the famous Egyptian statue, amaze with their curious shapes and mysterious origin.</p> <p>After the hike we will be transferred back to the capital Bucharest for the night where you will have free time for sightseeing. The city is famous for its vibrant Old Town district which is a fun mixture of local culture, history and entertainment. With its charming French-Italian vibe and grand buildings, it’s a buzzing area that seems to never sleep. This is where the guided trip ends.</p> <p>Monday 20th June</p> <p>After breakfast you will have some more time to explore Bucharest self guided, then make your way by bus or taxi to the airport for the flight back home. Please note that Uber currently operates in Bucharest as well. You may of course choose to stay an extra night to give you time to explore Bucharest fully.</p> <p>Discussion: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53342435\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53342435</a></p> <p>Cost and Payment</p> <p>The trip is £361 per person.

Come and enjoy this friendly and welcoming atmosphere together with a nice mixture of history, enjoyable activities and a pinch of daily life experience on these marvellous islands. Get the chance to explore a foreign island country where almost everyone speaks English and you won’t face the usual language barriers. History has left its traces on the magnificent buildings, Maltese traditions, cuisine and culture.</p> <p>We have an action-packed long weekend for you and what better way to see an island than by kayaking along the coast and then snorkelling to see what lies beneath the waves too.</p> <p>Consisting of three main inhabited islands - Malta, Gozo and Comino, we have put our focus on the less touristy and crowded part of the country - the Gozo and Comino islands.</p> <p>After getting accommodated in a nice cosy hotel, you will have the afternoon to go around the village of Xlendi and even walk to another village nearby. You can explore the mesmerising white sandy beaches of the Blue Lagoon (a fascinating piece of nature between Comino island and Cominotto islet). For the next couple of days, you are in for an adventure amongst a fabulous blend of Arabic, Mediterranean and Western cultures combined.</p> <p>Important Notes</p> <p>This trip requires swimming skills and being in good fitness. A liability form is also required to be filled in. If you are not a confident swimmer, we cannot accept you on this trip and no refund will be due.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Friday 17th June</p> <p>We land at Malta International Airport where a taxi driver will be waiting for us. Then we are heading to Gozo Island which includes a 30-minute ferry trip. We will have some time to get settled at the hotel and then our guide will give us brief welcome information and hand out the itinerary for our weekend. The rest of the afternoon will be free to leisurely explore the island.</p> <p>Saturday 18th June</p> <p>Have you tried diving? Malta &amp; Gozo are home to some world class diving, so whether you’re a beginner or a more experienced diver, you will find it hard not to fall in love with the extraordinary underwater world that surrounds these beautiful islands.</p> <p>You will have the morning free to explore the Gozitan capital Victoria or head for a quick swim. Then, the group will meet for lunch and prepare for diving.</p> <p>Pull on your mask and get ready to experience amazingly vivid blues, exceptionally clear visibility and incredible aquatic scenery. With plenty of marine life to discover hiding out in archways, caves and the many wrecks scattered around the island you won’t find a better diving place in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>If you are already an experienced diver with a Padi Open Water certificate, if you let us know at time of booking, we can arrange a dive for you accompanied by a qualified instructor at no extra cost.</p> <p>Sunday 19th June</p> <p>Time for kayaking and snorkeling. We set off in the morning with a kayak paddle to Comino Island. Then we will spend some time snorkelling, chilling on the beach and swimming in the azure waters of the Mediterranean. On the white sandy beach, we will also have our light picnic lunch. We will spend the afternoon in a leisurely continuation of our beach day.</p> <p>Monday 20th June</p> <p>A nice filling breakfast will mark the beginning of our trip back home. A transfer back to Malta airport will be arranged for around lunchtime marking the end of our 4-day island getaway.</p> <p>Please note: Outdooraholics and the tour guide reserve their right to amend the itinerary/swap days due to unpredictable weather conditions.

We are travelling so far from London, we are able to see the coast from parts of this hike.</p> <p>If you enjoy rolling hills, panoramic views stretching to the sea, rivers, windmills, Iron Age hill forts, and picturesque trails through beautiful rural Sussex, you have just found the perfect hike. We triumphantly finish our hike by passing through the striking gateway of Lewes Castle as we enter the ancient market town. To complete the day, we visit a pub for our usual end of hike refreshments.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Enjoy a superb elevated ridge hike with far reaching panoramic views</p> <p>• See the 200 year old Clayton windmills Jack and Jill</p> <p>• Conquer Ditchling Beacon (248m) - the third highest point in south east England that was the site of an Iron Age hill fort</p> <p>• Visit the ancient and well preserved market town of Lewes</p> <p>• Hike through the Castle Gate in Lewes - the castle originally built by William the Conqueror in 1069 after his invasion of Britain</p> <p>• Hike in the South Downs - one of the best National Parks in the south of England</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Our route takes us up onto the South Downs ridge past Jack and Jill - two well preserved windmills. Jack is the only \"male\" windmill in the UK (all others being considered female) and Jill was originally built in Brighton and moved by a team of horses and oxen and is still used to grind corn. Step by step we reach a dramatic panoramic view stretching to the English Channel, with Brighton perching gently in the foreground on the coast.</p> <p>Our adventure continues further along the northern edge of the South Downs with superb views inland until we reach Ditchling Beacon. The latter was the site of an Iron Age hill fort and is the third highest point in the South East of England at 248m and consequently has fabulous views across the Weald up to the North Downs Way. It was also the location of one of the Beacons that warned of the Spanish Armada in 1588. After a couple more peaks we drop down to follow the River Ouse into Lewes. We are welcomed into the old part of the town by a dramatic hike through the Castle Gate - the castle originally built by William the Conqueror in 1069 after his invasion of Britain.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9:02am train.

        "description": "<p>The latest in our series of new hikes, this is based on the old Devils Dyke hike we did in 2013, but a much improved route finishing at Shoreham on Sea.</p> <p>Our trail takes us across the South Downs along elevated tracks with superb far reaching views and both into and across chalk valleys. It’s quite a varied route with sections of woodland and for much of the time we will be high up on the South Downs Hills offering far reaching views. On our route the sea slowly gets closer until we finally hit the beach at the coastal town of Shoreham by Sea.</p> <p>Along our trail we visit the remains of the ancient Wolstonbury Hill Fort hill fort dating back around 3000 years to the Bronze Age - the Late Neolithic period.</p> <p>Please note, this hike is hilly hence the Tough rating, the ascent is approx 600/650m which is almost as much as some of our mountain hiking days.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike in the South Downs - one of the best National Parks in the South of England<br/>• Visit the remains of a Bronze Age hill fort<br/>• Hike along the ancient Devil's Dyke valley<br/>• Enjoy stunning coastal views as we approach our destination by the sea<br/>• Explore the adorable historical town and beach of Shoreham on Sea</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We start at Hassocks and our adventure takes us up onto the South Downs ridge, traversing part of the South Downs National Park, Britain's newest National Park. A 3000 year old route takes us along the top of the chalk highlands and passes by Wolstonbury Hill, a good location for wild orchid spotting with views almost as far as London. Our trail continues further along the chalk ridges of the famous South Downs Way with superb views both inland and to the sea. We then reach the Devil's Dyke, a deep valley surrounded by steep hills - one of the best view points of the South Downs where we can see The Sussex Weald and on a clear day, the Isle of Wight. It is the site of an Iron Age hillfort, and a pub. The view is so gorgeous, that a tourist railway and station was once built here just for day trippers to admire the view</p> <p>Our next stop is Fulking Hill, an area of bowl barrows containing archaeological remains and environmental evidence relating to the way the monument was constructed and used in the Late Neolithic and the Bronze Age. We enjoy more views from the top of the slope at Truleigh Hill, picked out by its distinctive masts, with the crown of trees on Chanctonbury Ring further on.</p> <p>The South Downs reward us with yet more fantastic and far reaching panoramas as we approach the sea on our way past the tiny Shoreham airport - the oldest commercial airport in the world with a protected 1936 art deco terminal building that plays host to many films including \"The Da Vinci Code\", Agatha Christie's \"Poirot\" and \"Woman in Gold\". We finish our hike in the historic fishing town of Shoreham on Sea for a well earned drink and rest.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9:02am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.</p> <p>We meet between WHSmith (no 34) and Nero Express (no 29) - [MAP LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx</a>)</p> <p>Planned arrival time back into London is 7pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for the day until then)</p> <p>**Food**</p> <p>We'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

We’ll experience Berber culture and Moroccan cuisine in Toubkal Mountain refuge before we hike to the summit. We then have time to explore Marrakech and stay in a centrally located basic hotel.</p> <p>The Toubkal adventure in the High Atlas starts from the Marrakech airport - we’ll be picked up and driven to Imlil village where our hike begins. Once our luggage is loaded on the mules, we begin the ascent to the Toubkal Mountain Refuge (3207m) where we’ll spend our first night high in the mountains. Next morning is the exhilarating climbing of Mt Toubkal followed by descent down to the refuge for lunch. After our meal we descend to Imlil and get a transfer to Marrakech for our hotel stay in the heart of the city. In the evening you’ll have some time on your hands for a stroll around central Marrakech and a bit of exploration.</p> <p>An exceptional long weekend packed with stunning landscapes, rich Moroccan culture and local cuisine.</p> <p>This location is so great that Sir Richard Branson has bought a villa here and we actually met him on the trails in October 2017.</p> <p>Important Notes</p> <p>Although it’s a short trip, these are very tough mountain hikes on steep paths with rocks and boulders for long sections and on the second day about 10 to 12 hours of solid hiking. There are also long ascents and descents. This is a trip only suitable for very fit and experienced hikers. This is our toughest hiking trip.</p> <p>Hiking boots with ankle protection are essential due to the rough, uneven and rocky terrain - you will have to climb over boulders and rocks. You should be prepared for early starts and late finishes, this trip is exhilarating but exhausting and is not for everyone.</p> <p>Altitude Warning</p> <p>Please note that we are hiking to a high altitude which affects everyone differently, you may get some mild signs of altitude sickness. We are spending our first night at the Neltner Refuge which is at 3207m and will help with acclimatisation. The following day we hike to the summit (approx 1000m ascent) and on reaching the summit we will usually descend within about 15 to 30 minutes. There are tablets available that you can buy in advance to help reduce or eliminate the effects of altitude sickness - we cannot advise on this but please see your doctor for details. Should you experience signs of Acute Mountain Sickness like headaches, nausea, dizziness or breathing difficulties, you should consult your guide immediately and you may need to descend back to the Mountain Hut, although this is rare.</p> <p>\\*Please note that your luggage while hiking will be transferred by mules. Therefore, there is a luggage limit of 15kg per person, but about 10kg should be aimed for and please pack into a large rucksack (no suitcases or hard bags please).</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Saturday 11th June</p> <p>Saturday's hike: Imlil to Toubkal (Neltner) Refuge<br/>Distance: 8 miles (approx 12km)<br/>Ascent: Approx 1500m<br/>Grading: Tough - Mountain - tough and long hike: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a><br/>Hiking time: About 5-6 hours of hiking</p> <p>Our private transfer will pick us up from Marrakech Menara Airport and take us to the village of Imlil. At Imlil we’ll load our luggage on the mules and start our hike having lunch about 1 hour in. Rising through the secluded Atlas mountains and through several picturesque passes, we will reach the small traditional Mountain Refuge under the top of Mt Toubkal - Neltner Refuge (3207m), where we will spend the night. Please note: The Refuge is a mountain hut and is basic accommodation in large mixed gender dormitories with bunk beds. Food here is very simple.</p> <p>Sunday 12th June</p> <p>Sunday's hike: Toubkal (Neltner) Refuge - Mt Toubkal - Imlil<br/>Distance: 13 miles (approx 21km)<br/>Ascent: Approx 1000m<br/>Descent: 2468m<br/>Grading: Tough - Mountain - very steep hike scrambling over rocks and boulders in places: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a><br/>Hiking time: About 10 to 12 hours of actual hiking</p> <p>Today we make the ascent of Mt Toubkal (4167m). We wake at about 3:00am and after a quick breakfast we start our ascent in dark aiming to hit the summit to see sunrise, which depends on the group pace. Passing boulders and accompanied by magnificent views of several peaks, in 3 to 4 hours of walking we arrive at the distinctive metal tripod which marks the summit. The summit rewards with spectacular views on every side - we’ll see incredible high Atlas peaks and admire stunning views of the Atlas range along with far-reaching views towards the Sahara Desert - truly memorable sights.</p> <p>Descending Toubkal, we come down to the Refuge for lunch and then to Imlil, where we get a transfer back to Marrakech for our hotel stay and an evening to explore Marrakech. Please note, the hotel in Marrakech is a basic but well located guest house. Please don't expect Western Europe Hotel standards.</p> <p>Monday 13th June</p> <p>Our long weekend trip ends after breakfast. Should you want to stay more days, feel free to arrange these for yourself. You could also book a later flight in the evening to spend another day in Marrakech. Alternatively it works well to come out on Friday, have time in Marrakech and then meet the group on Saturday.</p> <p>Click here for the discussion forum:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53229848\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53229848</a></p> <p>Cost</p> <p>The trip is £257 per person.</p> <p>To join us please RSVP Yes and pay the £100 deposit by PayPal with the remainder due by bank within 3 working days after booking.

        "description": "<p>Hike designed for beginners!</p> <p>Woodland, attractive towns, castles, river trails and chalk hills. This hike has a bit of nearly everything. We're off to historic Arundel in Sussex and breaking with tradition we'll also have a brief stop mid hike at a delightful little pub on the banks of the river Arun for that irresistible sneaky river side pint to satisfy the Outdoor Alcoholics.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike the chalk hills with breathtaking views to the distant sea</p> <p>• Explore the landscaped Arundel Park with its woodland, Swanbourne lake, meadows and the Gothic Hiorne Tower</p> <p>• Superb views of the 12th century Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Follow the river Arun on a picturesque trail towards Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Visit the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral (French Gothic style)</p> <p>• Riverside pub visit</p> <p>• Visit the well preserved Sussex ancient market town of Arundel</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>A delightful mix of scenery with a good stretch along the river Arun, a visit to the woods and hills of Arundel Park and the striking and extravagant castellated Hiorne tower. We'll then venture into Arundel with its Gothic and enchanting castle dominating and looming over the town to finish our hike by finding the mighty Arundel Cathedral. We'll get some far off and ever nearing views of the castle as we follow the meandering and lazy river Arun. As well as the quick mid hike pub stop we'll have our usual refreshments in Arundel before making our way back to London. We'll pop up to hike past Arundel Cathedral but sadly can't get into the grounds or very close to Arundel Castle as admission is charged.</p> <p>With just under 2500 inhabitants Arundel is a small town, but has been home to the very rich and powerful Dukes of Norfolk for over 400 years. The original Mott and Bailey castle was built on the site in 1067 by the Normans after their invasion of Britain in 1066 and has since been rebuilt and expanded to provide the grand modern day stately home. The castle is still inhabited by the Dukes of Norfolk with the 18th Duke residing there currently. Hiorne Tower was built in Arundel Park in 1787 as an extravagant folly for the Duke of Norfolk and has a commanding position high on the hills and is quite enchanting and captivating.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:20am for the 9:35am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.</p> <p>We meet between WHSmith (no 34) and Nero Express (no 29) - [MAP LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx</a>)</p> <p>Planned arrival time back into London is 6:15pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for the day until then)</p> <p>**Food**</p> <p>We'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

        "description": "<p>We have put together this fantastic 3 day trip - we're off to the Brecon Beacons National park for Hiking and Partying!</p> <p>This is one of three trips we organise to very different areas of this fabulous mountain range. This one to the central Brecons provides both the best hiking and takes in what are probably the three most popular and truly spectacular walks in this National Park.</p> <p>Our trip leader Graham knows his area very well having spent 4 years living close by and he's done the main hike on this trip over 27 times!</p> <p>We’ll spend a day walking over the mountains that surround the Neuadd reservoir and then on Sunday we’ll take in a less tough waterfall walk. Sunday is saved for the beautiful Tor Y Foel. We'll also have a party one evening after our group meal in the gorgeous setting or our remote converted barn - the only 5 star rated hostel in the UK!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>* 3 gorgeous and contrasting hikes high in the Brecon Beacons National Park<br/>* Stay in a lovely converted stone barn eco hostel - awarded the Greenest hostel in the UK status in 2013<br/>* A fully catered trip<br/>* A closer trip than usual - only about 3 hours driving from London<br/>* Hike the iconic Brecons Horseshoe<br/>* Enjoy gorgeous scenery passing 4 stunning waterfalls</p> <p>Photos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>Click [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics</a>) to join our Facebook community</p> <p>**Weekend Description**</p> <p>The Horseshoe walk is the most popular in the Brecon Beacons and it's easy to see why with staggering views as it takes in 3 mountain peaks. Having hiked the entire National Park extensively, it's the guide's personal favourite. It's fairly tough but offers breath taking views over the flat land to the North and back into the Brecon Beacons mountain range and on a clear day you can even see the sea and Gower Peninsula.</p> <p>The waterfalls walk is a less tough walk and passes 4 substantial waterfalls, one of which we actually walk behind. With a huge torrent of water rushing past and the noise and spray, it's a pretty exhilarating experience by itself. There is some gorgeous scenery and superb photo opportunities as we follow the winding trail of the river and we'll also visit the largest cave opening in South Wales where we can walk inside.</p> <p>We are staying in one of the only 5 star hostels in the UK - a gorgeous converted stone barn remote in the Brecon Beacons. With an ultra low carbon footprint, this eco hostel has been awarded the Greenest hostel in the UK status in 2013. To fully enjoy our rural mountainous setting and so that everyone can get to know each other, we will be enjoying a group meal in the evening.</p> <p>On the last day we take in the smaller peak of Tor Y Foel which offers fine views of the surrounding area, being a very isolated peak. We’ll then follow the Brecon and Monmouthshire canal (which has been restored and is now navigable) into the village of Talybont and enjoy the option of a pub drink before driving back.</p> <p>**ITINERARY**</p> <p>Thursday 28th July</p> <p>Head over to the hostel which we have hired exclusively for our group.</p> <p>Friday 29th July</p> <p>Friday's hike: The Brecon Horseshoe<br/>Distance: 9 miles (14km)<br/>Ascent: Approx 600m<br/>Grading: Challenging, one steep climb at the start, a good level of fitness required (we are taking in 3 mountain peaks in about 5 to 6 hours of walking) - click [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a>) for details</p> <p>The walk takes in the highest mountain in South Wales - Pen Y Fan (886m) as well as the mountain peaks of Corn Du and Cribyn. It’s a dramatic, raw and rugged landscape dotted with occasional reservoirs and set above valleys and rivers, made even more exhilarating by the ridge top walks and far stretching views.</p> <p>After the hike we return to our barn hostel for a 3 course dinner followed by a party</p> <p>Saturday 30th July</p> <p>Saturday's hike: The waterfalls of the Afon Mellte river<br/>Distance: 6 miles (9km)<br/>Ascent: 270m<br/>Grading: Intermediate/Challenging, with rough stony ground in places and steep sections, it can be slippery - click [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a>) for details</p> <p>We’ll follow the Afon Mellte river through a deep and rich woodland valley passing four waterfalls on the way. The area has very lush vegetation and has been designated a site of special scientific interest. We'll get to actually walk behind a waterfall too as well as venture into the mouth of the largest cave opening in South Wales.</p> <p>After the hike we return to our barn for a barbecue that we'll all get involved in cooking</p> <p>Sunday 31st July</p> <p>Sunday's hike: Tor Y Foel and the Monmouthsire and Brecon canal<br/>Distance: 7.5 to 9 miles (12km to 15km)<br/>Grading: Beginner/Intermediate, one main hill to climb - click [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings</a>) for details</p> <p>We'll hike to the peak of Tor Y Foel which offers superb views of the surrounding area before following a gorgeous and picture postcard trail along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal (dating from 1796) that takes us to the village of Talybont.</p> <p>**Cost and Payment**</p> <p>The trip is £248 per person.

        "description": "<p>Our toughest day hike from London - are you up for the challenge?</p> <p>Taking in the three highest peaks in Surrey - Box hill (224m), Leith Hill (294m) and Holmbury Hill (261m) and being nearly as long as the Yorkshire Three Peaks, they are also known as the Yorkshire cousins. This is a formidable challenge and very accessible from London in a day.</p> <p>As well as being a stunning route in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty it's also a great training hike for anyone doing a big challenge this year like The Yorkshire or National 3 Peaks as well as Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Conquer the 3 Surrey peaks - situation in an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”</p> <p>• Enjoy breathtaking hiking through the woods and hills of the North Downs</p> <p>• Hike through England's largest vineyard - Denbies Wine Estate</p> <p>• See the twisting Box hill roads of the 2012 Olympics cycle race where the cyclists did 9 laps of this spectacular section</p> <p>• Great training hike for any tough challenges you have coming up</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>As well as being a great challenge, this hike is also stunningly beautiful, taking in much of the Surrey Hills, Surrey is the most heavily wooded county in England and also conveniently very close to London.</p> <p>Hiking for 21 miles and taking in some amazing scenery across the three Surrey peaks, our trail will pass through ancient sandy trails and woodlands and offers spectacular views from all three of the hills. Upon reaching Leith Hill we get some of the most far reaching views of any hike we do - being the second highest point in South East England. We will see as far as the South Downs by the sea and on a clear day from the Northern edge of the hill we can see several central London landmark buildings</p> <p>This is a tough hike, but if needed it’s easy to skip the last hill and hence shorten the hike a little if you want (self guided). Due to the length of the hike we do not have our usual end of hike pub stop</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8am leaving the meeting point at 8:15am for the 8:25am train.

        "description": "<p>Join us in this picturesque exploration of the North Downs and the gorgeous Kent countryside, also known as the \"Garden of England\". This hike takes us on a hilly trail through magnificent rolling uplands, dry valleys and shady woodlands using the ancient routes of the Weald Way, the Pilgrims Way and the North Downs Way.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike through picturesque parts of the Pilgrims, North Downs and Weald Ways to discover a stunning part of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</p> <p>• See the remains of the ancient village of Dode wiped out by the plague long ago but with its 1000 year old church still remaining</p> <p>• See the long barrow of Coldrum Stones - 1000 years older than Stonehenge</p> <p>• Hike through the spectacular Cobham Woods and the ancient Deer Park home to the Darnley Mausoleum</p> <p>• Visit Cobham with its links to Charles Dickens and its historic buildings such as Cobham College - the quadrangular building retaining the remains of the original foundations of the college built by Sir John de Cobham in 1362</p> <p>• Pass by Luddesdown Court - with its Grade I listed church and manor building with oak beam hall and stone dressing</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Our journey begins at Sole Street from where we go through vast rolling fields passing Luddesdown Court. Following the Weald Way, we pass through the lost village of Dode dating from Roman times but wiped out by the great plague leaving just its 1000 year old Norman Church building and legend has it ghosts too.</p> <p>Passing tranquil shady woods along the Weald Way, we hike to the long barrow of Coldrum Stones constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period and whose name means \"place of enchantments\". It is one of the earliest prehistoric monuments in Britain - more than 1000 older than Stonehenge and offers stunning views from its top.</p> <p>Next we head along the ancient Pilgrims Way to the top of the North Downs escarpment again to have lunch. Crossing through more than eight different woods, we reach Upper Bush - a beautiful hamlet. Much of this section of the hike goes through very peaceful countryside with a remote feeling making you believe you are far away from anywhere!</p> <p>Following another ascent, we reach the gorgeous Cobham Woods which is an old deer park containing the impressive Darnley Mausoleum. From here we eventually reach the beautiful and historic village of Cobham which has a 13th century church with reportedly some of the finest and oldest brass memorials in England. Here we will stop to rest a while at one of the village's three pubs - a medieval timber framed pub that was a favorite of Charles Dickens. After our well deserved drink we head off through orchards back to Sole Street for the return train home.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:42am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>Col is well known to the group - he is both Mountain Rescue and also a Mountain Leader and leads all of our tougher and more challenging mountain hikes.</p> <p>A NEW trip for 2022 and it may be a one off special</p> <p>A challenging day hike that will take you to the summit of the third highest mountain in England, Helvellyn (949m). So long as the weather is suitable we will cross the iconic Striding Edge on the way up before ticking off Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike, Dollywaggon Pike, St Sunday Crag, Birks and Arnison Crag before arriving back in Patterdale.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Approx 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Climb the third highest mountain in England, Helvellyn (949m)</p> <p>• Discover England's largest National park which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site - The Lake District</p> <p>• Take in five other summits (all Wainwrights): Nethermost Pike (891m), Dollywaggon Pike (858m), St Sunday Crag (841m), Birks (622m) and Arnison Crag (433m)</p> <p>• Tackle the stunning Striding Edge</p> <p>• See the secluded Grisedale Tarn and the Brothers Parting Stone where the poet, William Wordsworth said goodbye to his brother, John for the last time</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Starting in the pretty village of Patterdale outside the parish church of St Patrick from which the village takes its name, we hike up to the summit of Helvellyn. So long as the weather is suitable, we will cross the iconic, knife edge arete of Striding Edge which has a large amount of exposure and is seriously only for those with a head for heights. If the weather is less than perfect then a different route will be chosen.</p> <p>Once we have reached the summit of Helvellyn, with its wide ranging views across the rest of the Lake District and the distant North Pennines (even Scotland on a clear day) then we will keep to high ground to the summits of Nethermost Pike and Dollywaggon Pike which are also in the list of England’s top ten highest mountains. Once we leave Dollywaggon Pike we will head down for a little while to arrive at Grisedale Pike and The Brother’s Parting Stone where William Wordsworth said goodbye to his sea captain brother, John for the last time before he was sadly drowned in a shipwreck but, which is an idyllic place to stop and have lunch and look down the valley of Grisedale to Ullswater lake and the large, imposing shape of St Sunday Crag which we will be climbing once we have finished eating.</p> <p>Once lunch is over we will start to climb again up a small path that takes us to the summit of our next mountain, St Sunday Crag (841m) which, in Trail magazine, is listed as one of the top 100 mountains in the UK (along with Helvellyn from this hike). The view from the top is dramatic, looking to Fairfield one way, almost lengthways down Ullswater and side on to the profile of Striding Edge. From there we take a steep but increasingly easy path to climb two subsidiary summits of Birks and Arnison Crags before arriving back into Patterdale</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at 8:45am at at the car parking at the side of the road near to Patterdale and CA11 0NL</p> <p>Map of meeting point: [LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/39CYpOc\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/39CYpOc</a>)</p> <p>We recommend you to arrive the night before and stay nearby.

        "description": "<p>We venture to Kent again and this hike certainly illustrates why it's known as the \"Garden of England\". We visit the village of Otford which dates back over 3000 years and two other villages. A delightful rural hike which amongst other things takes us past two castles – Eynsford Castle and Lullingstone Castle and along a stretch of the River Darent.</p> <p>We hike the Darent Valley Path alongside the River Darent and through the picturesque Kent fields and ancient wood. The area’s beauty attracted the Romans to settle here and in 80 AD Lullingstone Villa was constructed for a wealthy Roman who was keen on pagan worship.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Pass the magnificent Lullingstone Castle</p> <p>• Hike along a delightful stretch of the Darent Valley Path</p> <p>• Pass the site of the ruins of Lullingstone Roman Villa with its pagan history</p> <p>• Hike through the picturesque Lullingstone Country Park</p> <p>• Visit the remains Eynsford Castle</p> <p>• Explore 3 charming Kentish villages</p> <p>• Hike through the 22 metre high Eynsford Rail Viaduct with its nine red brick arches</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We start from the picturesque village of Otford, occupied for at least 3000 years. Through the centuries Otford has been home to Iron Age farmers, Romans, Royalty and Archbishops. Our hike takes us through the tranquil woods and grasslands of the Kentish countryside reaching the quaint Shoreham town where the Darent Valley Path takes us to the magnificent Lullingstone Country Park. The park is internationally important due to its collection of ancient trees including beech, ash, oak, sweet chestnut and hornbeam some of which are believed to be 800 years old.</p> <p>We reach Lullingstone Castle to admire its tranquil lake before we pass the historical Lullingstone Roman Villa - one of the few Roman estate survivals in Britain whose construction began in about 100 AD.</p> <p>From there, our hike continues among the rolling fields of Kent which reward with views towards the 9 arched Eynsford Rail Viaduct. Reaching the tranquil village of Eynsford, we explore the remains of Eynsford Castle - a medieval fortification built in 1088 and we finish our hike with a stroll along the lovely village.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:15am for the 9:25am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>Join us for a daring hike to the Yorkshire Three Peaks! One of the toughest and most adventurous routes in England covering a distance of 40km and summiting 3 mountains in one day!</p> <p>The hike offers spectacular far reaching views and challenging rugged terrain and is set within the breathtaking Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route climbs a total of about 1500m of ascent with a few steep sections.</p> <p>This is the toughest and most challenging hike Outdooraholics do in the UK and is not for beginners!</p> <p>For further details on this trip please see our Yorkshire 3 Peaks PDF- [LINK](<a href=\"https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire3Peaks.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire3Peaks.pdf</a>)</p> <p>To check in to the Yorkshire Three Peaks Facebook page: [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireThreePeaksChallenge\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireThreePeaksChallenge</a>)</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Undertake this famous and formidable 40km hilly challenge</p> <p>• Small group of just 14 hikers</p> <p>• Build your own weekend trip around this day hike</p> <p>• Challenging hiking experience in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park</p> <p>• Climb Whernside - the highest peak in the Yorkshire Dales at 736m</p> <p>• Enjoy spectacular views across the Yorkshire Dales National Park - on a clear day we can also see the Lake District and the sea</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>• The perfect challenge to set yourself for 2020 or great training for anyone doing big hikes like Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>The three peaks to be climbed are Pen-y-ghent (694m), Whernside (736m) and Ingleborough (723m) with each peak offering a different degree of difficulty. We will do the most popular hike starting in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale and the hike is around 25 miles (40km) long with a total of about 1500m of ascent.</p> <p>The ascent of Ingleborough passes large areas of limestone rock before the path gets steeper and rockier as we reach the flat summit with its ancient fortifications and views across Morecambe Bay and on a clear day the Lake District. A steep descent eventually leads to the hamlet of Chapel le Dale and the gradual climb to the top of the second peak, Whernside (736m), the highest point in North Yorkshire. The route back down takes us alongside one of the wonders of the industrial revolution, Ribblehead viaduct (built in 1874, 400m wide and using 1.5 million bricks)! There now follows a long hike through fantastic limestone scenery before a steep climb up to the top of Pen y Ghent and then a quick drop down the front (with some easy scrambling) back to Horton. A very fine challenge and also a superb hike.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Horton car park at 7:45am (20m south of BD24 0HF on B6479) and leave at 8am prompt - please buy a parking ticket to cover all day. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.</p> <p>Typical end time at 6:30pm to 8:30pm.<br/>Street view of meeting point - [LINK](<a href=\"http://goo.gl/kfbjqh\" class=\"linkified\">http://goo.gl/kfbjqh</a>)</p> <p>Map of meeting point: [LINK](<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/QW8mpXGNJdv\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/QW8mpXGNJdv</a>)</p> <p>You will need transport to and from the start of this hike, which is outside London. Outdooraholics cannot get involved with private lift share arrangements, however we have set up a lift share discussion where you can offer/request lifts - [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53393493\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53393493</a>). Please contact people via this forum and post there if you can offer or need a lift or plan to hire a car and can offer spaces.</p> <p>This trip is viable on public transport, you can check the train from London Kings Cross to Horton-in-Ribblesdale which runs about every two hours (and it's approximately a 4-hour-ride).

        "description": "<p>Join us to explore the hidden treasures of Eden Valley, stepping back in ancient times while soaking in the rich green hues of this picturesque landscape! We embark upon a journey through time past ancient woodlands, tranquil rivers and remarkable historical buildings. These divine landscapes with their rolling hills, grassy fields and deciduous woods are keepers of many medieval houses and castles that can be traced back to the 11th century. Starting from Tonbridge, where many of Jane Austen's family houses are located, we hike through the countryside to pass the hunting lodge of King Henry VIII and reach Chiddingstone - a Tudor one street village. We pass by Leigh and end the hike back in Tonbridge with a view of the motte and bailey Tonbridge castle.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Discover the picturesque Eden Valley</p> <p>• Pass the Medieval Manor House Penshurst Place - a hunting lodge of King Henry VIII</p> <p>• Visit one of Kent’s most attractive villages - Chiddingstone - famed for its architecture, ghost stories and use as a filming location</p> <p>• Hike along the banks of the rivers Eden and Medway in the High Weald area - considered one of the best surviving medieval landscapes in Northern Europe</p> <p>• Visit the buzzing Tonbridge - a market town from the Middle Ages</p> <p>• Pass the 11th century Tonbridge Castle - a great example of motte and bailey gatehouse beside the River Medway</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We start off in Tonbridge village, with its idyllic manors and picture postcard castle. As we reach Haysden Country Park, our hike opens up to the breathtaking greens across parkland, woodlands, open fields and low hills. The High Weald is considered to be one of the best surviving medieval landscapes in Northern Europe. The area boasts the highest proportion of ancient woodland in the country and is one of the most densely wooded landscapes in Britain. Following a sunken lane, we start treading in the steps of Saxon drovers. We take a short break to admire Penshurst Place - an impressive sight that has kept rich history throughout the decades. The original medieval house is one of the most complete surviving examples of 14th century domestic architecture in England. In the mid 16th century it was the hunting ground of Henry VIII.</p> <p>Our path crosses the rivers Eden and Medway meandering across the enchanting Eden Valley. In the afternoon the charming Chiddingstone will accommodates us for lunch. It is a potent example of a single street Tudor village in typical Kent style. The village shop and post office date back to 1453 – just before the Wars of the Roses. After lunch we pass by Leigh and we see the remains of Tonbridge Castle, built in the 11th century and reputedly England's finest example of a motte and bailey castle.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Charing Cross station at 8:10am leaving the meeting point at 8:25am for the 8:40am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>Photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

        "description": "<p>We’re off to the North Downs in Surrey - an area so spectacular it’s been designated an official Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This hike starts at the charming historic town of Guildford which has a long and varied history dating back thousands of years to the Bronze Age and more recently to the castle that the Normans built 1000 years ago.</p> <p>Our hike reveals lush countryside, bright and open woodlands and follows the River Wey Canal - we go beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings for which Guildford is famed. We visit an enchanting ancient church nestling on St Martha’s Hill with breathtaking panoramic views almost as far as the sea. We then finish in Guildford to get a glimpse of this picture postcard town that’s just a 35 minute train journey from London.</p> <p>This hike was designed and written by one of our hike leaders who was born and lived in Guildford and we show you its undiscovered gems!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Explore the beautiful Surrey countryside Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</p> <p>• Admire the far reaching views of St Martha's hill with its historic church</p> <p>• Visit Guildford - Surrey's most significant ancient town with Bronze Age roots and see for yourself why it has attracted many famous residents.</p> <p>• Follow the tranquil River Wey as it gently flows past willow trees through rural Surrey</p> <p>• Visit the enchanting ruins of the 14th century St Catherine's Chapel - which attracted the artist Turner to paint it in 1807 and 1808</p> <p>• Hike along part of the North Downs Way - the 2nd most acclaimed long distance route in South East England</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Guildford is best known for being a picturesque and quaint market town near London, but the countryside has far more to offer than most visitors discover beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings. Famous past and current residents include Lewis Carroll - author of Alice in Wonderland, Jodie Kidd, Alan Turin, Terry Jones (the Monty Python writer) and Yvonne Arnaud. William Turner came to paint St Catherine's Church in 1707 and 1708 and his paintings now hang in the Tate Gallery.</p> <p>Once in Guildford we hike along the picturesque River Wey canal where the nestled boat houses sit on this tranquil waterway leading us to the ruin of St Catherine's church. We then hike into Bluebell Woods where we join the ancient North Downs Way path along a ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we come to the remote and isolated St Martha’s church built in the 12th century.</p> <p>From here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see seven counties from this point. We then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory built by the East India Company in 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now an enchanting derelict site covering 27 acres with much to see including relics, tramways and buildings from its nearly 400 year history.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Waterloo station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.</p> <p>We meet under the main central clock.

We're off to historic Arundel in Sussex and breaking with tradition we'll also have a brief stop mid hike at a delightful little pub on the banks of the river Arun for that irresistible sneaky river side pint to satisfy the Outdoor Alcoholics.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike the chalk hills with breathtaking views to the distant sea</p> <p>• Explore the landscaped Arundel Park with its woodland, Swanbourne lake, meadows and the Gothic Hiorne Tower</p> <p>• Superb views of the 12th century Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Follow the river Arun on a picturesque trail towards Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Visit the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral (French Gothic style)</p> <p>• Riverside pub visit</p> <p>• Visit the well preserved Sussex ancient market town of Arundel</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>A delightful mix of scenery with a good stretch along the river Arun, a visit to the woods and hills of Arundel Park and the striking and extravagant castellated Hiorne tower. We'll then venture into Arundel with its Gothic and enchanting castle dominating and looming over the town to finish our hike by finding the mighty Arundel Cathedral. We'll get some far off and ever nearing views of the castle as we follow the meandering and lazy river Arun. As well as the quick mid hike pub stop we'll have our usual refreshments in Arundel before making our way back to London. We'll pop up to hike past Arundel Cathedral but sadly can't get into the grounds or very close to Arundel Castle as admission is charged.</p> <p>With just under 2500 inhabitants Arundel is a small town, but has been home to the very rich and powerful Dukes of Norfolk for over 400 years. The original Mott and Bailey castle was built on the site in 1067 by the Normans after their invasion of Britain in 1066 and has since been rebuilt and expanded to provide the grand modern day stately home. The castle is still inhabited by the Dukes of Norfolk with the 18th Duke residing there currently. Hiorne Tower was built in Arundel Park in 1787 as an extravagant folly for the Duke of Norfolk and has a commanding position high on the hills and is quite enchanting and captivating.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:15am for the 9:20am train.

        "description": "<p>A picturesque hiking trail through the Chilterns Hills - an officially designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.</p> <p>This is a great hike towards the prominent beauty spot of Ivinghoe Beacon with some superb far reaching views. It is also a beginners hike and we return to London earlier than usual, so it is ideal for people new to hiking or those who have plans for the evening. We finish in a picture postcard country pub for some well deserved refreshments.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike to the start of the famous Ridgeway Trail - Britain's oldest trail dating back at least 5000 years</p> <p>• Get views of the huge 147m white lion carved into the hillside at Whipsnade</p> <p>• Walk some fantastic hills in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</p> <p>• Visit the Bridgewater Monument - a 33m tall tower built in 1832 in memory of the third Duke of Bridgewater</p> <p>• Visit the tiny village of Aldbury - a picturesque setting often referred to as a ''chocolate-box'' village due to its traditional appearance</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike takes in both some stunning scenery and a good bit of history. We hike through beech woodland, chalk uplands and get some great views over the vale of Aldbury before leading back through the woods of the Ashridge Estate - the former home of the Dukes of Bridgewater. We then drop into the quaint and unspoilt village of Aldbury. Part of our route takes us along the ancient path of the famous Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britain's oldest road and we also pass the Bridgewater Monument - created to honour the Duke who built one of Britain's first canals.</p> <p>Ivinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\".</p> <p>For the attentive and sharp eyed a 483 foot long white lion carved into a distant chalk hill is also visible from the stunning panorama of Ivinghoe Beacon.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Euston station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9:03am train.

On the way there, we will hike along the elevated South Downs hills, summiting Ditchling Beacon to enjoy splendid sea views and diverse countryside, as the sea gets larger and larger and eventually we'll end up on the beach at Brighton.</p> <p>We will also have some time to explore Brighton itself - wander along the famous Lanes with the sound of the buskers livening up the streets, and lose ourselves in the bars, cafe's and independent jewellery and antique shops. You can even get a zip wire experience on the seafront. We will have some time to enjoy the pebble beach, and if you're feeling really in the seaside mood, grab some good old British Fish and Chips.

Instead, this route starts off at Hassocks and then traverses north to south exploring hidden valleys, woods, open green expanses and parkland.</p> <p>The end point is the lively town of Brighton, famous for its vibrant nightlife, and we will be rewarded with a trip to the sea at Brighton Waterfront. Before that we will pass through the cosy village of Ditchling, then stand atop Ditchling Beacon, explore the green expanse of the Stanmer Park, pass Stanmer House, then walk through the University of Sussex campus to Falmer. We will enjoy a lovely view of the sea from Kemp Town Racecourse and then walk into the splendour that is Brighton.

        "description": "<p>A picturesque adventure through England's most wooded county with a variety of attractions from historic buildings, picture postcard rural rivers and even a Witches cave. A glorious circular hike from the ancient market town of Farnham steeped in history going back nearly 1000 years on this trail through time. One of the very first Outdooraholics hikes from all those years ago, but still a timeless classic.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Explore the romantic and enchanting ruins of an abandoned abbey dating back nearly 1000 years</p> <p>• Visit the famous and picture postcard Tilford village cricket green</p> <p>• See an 800 year old oak tree</p> <p>• Visit a cave where supposedly a White Witch lived (Mother Ludlam)</p> <p>• Explore the Bourne Woods and see where Gladiator and over 20 other films were set</p> <p>• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey through woodland paths</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Starting in the historic and attractive Georgian market town of Farnham, we go on a woodland valley trail via Mother Ludlam's cave (home to the White Witch of Waverley according to the legend), past Moor Park House, and then on to explore the site of Waverley Abbey ruins (founded 1128) and to see the grand Waverley Abbey House set on a lake. Our trail passes the famous cricket green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the River Wey and flanked by two medieval stone bridges and then onto the Bourne Woods.</p> <p>Tilford Green is a superb example of a traditional village green from a long gone era - with a cricket pitch, pub and two medieval stone bridges. We then head on to visit an 800 year old oak tree (8 metre girth) before making our way back to Farnham. We also pass a farm where we see pigs (and often baby piglets). The Bourne woods has an interesting mix of heathland and coniferous trees and its beauty has drawn filmmakers for films such as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Princess, War Horse and at least 20 others - we'll be hiking through the area where these were filmed.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Waterloo station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9:05am train.

        "description": "<p>The beauty of Box Hill has inspired many great artists, writers and musicians for hundreds of years. Jane Austen based the picnic scene from ''Emma'' here, George Lambert's famous painting of Box Hill in 1733 (now in the Tate Gallery) and it's even had several songs written about it, the most recent being ''On Box Hill'' by Everything But the Girl. It also inspired the poet Keats and the writer G.K. Chesterton.

        "description": "<p>Our toughest day hike from London - are you up for the challenge?</p> <p>Taking in the three highest peaks in Surrey - Box hill (224m), Leith Hill (294m) and Holmbury Hill (261m) and being nearly as long as the Yorkshire Three Peaks, they are also known as the Yorkshire cousins. This is a formidable challenge and very accessible from London in a day.</p> <p>As well as being a stunning route in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty it's also a great training hike for anyone doing a big challenge this year like The Yorkshire or National 3 Peaks as well as Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Conquer the 3 Surrey peaks - situation in an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”</p> <p>• Enjoy breathtaking hiking through the woods and hills of the North Downs</p> <p>• Hike through England's largest vineyard - Denbies Wine Estate</p> <p>• See the twisting Box hill roads of the 2012 Olympics cycle race where the cyclists did 9 laps of this spectacular section</p> <p>• Great training hike for any tough challenges you have coming up</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>As well as being a great challenge, this hike is also stunningly beautiful, taking in much of the Surrey Hills, Surrey is the most heavily wooded county in England and also conveniently very close to London.</p> <p>Hiking for 21 miles and taking in some amazing scenery across the three Surrey peaks, our trail will pass through ancient sandy trails and woodlands and offers spectacular views from all three of the hills. Upon reaching Leith Hill we get some of the most far reaching views of any hike we do - being the second highest point in South East England. We will see as far as the South Downs by the sea and on a clear day from the Northern edge of the hill we can see several central London landmark buildings</p> <p>This is a tough hike, but if needed it’s easy to skip the last hill and hence shorten the hike a little if you want (self guided). Due to the length of the hike we do not have our usual end of hike pub stop</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8am leaving the meeting point at 8:15am for the 8:25am train.

A glorious circular hike from the ancient market town of Farnham steeped in history going back nearly 1000 years on this trail through time. One of the very first Outdooraholics hikes from all those years ago, but still a timeless classic.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Explore the romantic and enchanting ruins of an abandoned abbey dating back nearly 1000 years</p> <p>• Visit the famous and picture postcard Tilford village cricket green</p> <p>• See an 800 year old oak tree</p> <p>• Visit a cave where supposedly a White Witch lived (Mother Ludlam)</p> <p>• Explore the Bourne Woods and see where Gladiator and over 20 other films were set</p> <p>• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey through woodland paths</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Starting in the historic and attractive Georgian market town of Farnham, we go on a woodland valley trail via Mother Ludlam's cave (home to the White Witch of Waverley according to the legend), past Moor Park House, and then on to explore the site of Waverley Abbey ruins (founded 1128) and to see the grand Waverley Abbey House set on a lake. Our trail passes the famous cricket green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the River Wey and flanked by two medieval stone bridges and then onto the Bourne Woods.</p> <p>Tilford Green is a superb example of a traditional village green from a long gone era - with a cricket pitch, pub and two medieval stone bridges. We then head on to visit an 800 year old oak tree (8 metre girth) before making our way back to Farnham. We also pass a farm where we see pigs (and often baby piglets). The Bourne woods has an interesting mix of heathland and coniferous trees and its beauty has drawn filmmakers for films such as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Princess, War Horse and at least 20 others - we'll be hiking through the area where these were filmed.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Waterloo station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>Join us to hike up the highest mountain in Wales and England - the mighty Snowdon Peak - Yr Wyddfa.</p> <p>Conquer this 1085 metre (3560 feet) giant through the secluded and wild side of Snowdon - Allt Maenderyn often referred to as the South Ridge. This lesser known, but gem of a route - Allt Maenderyn makes for a sublime and airy ridge walk. With its wild and untamed landscape, soaring, sharp and magnificent peaks rising up high above the deep valleys, picturesque villages and breathtaking beauty, we will show you why Snowdon is one of the world’s most popular mountains.</p> <p>The summit of Snowdon lies at the heart of the Snowdonia National Park - an area of unspoiled and outstanding natural beauty in Central Wales, established in 1951 as the third national park in Britain, following the Peak District and the Lake District. With its spectacular views and irreplaceable experience that is to offer, Snowdon is one of three mountains climbed as part of the National Three Peaks Challenge. It is a superb mountain, but sadly this also means it has become one of the busiest mountain paths in the world, join us on this gem of a route, escape the crowds and have an exciting and quieter route up Snowdon.</p> <p>Explore the mountain that was used for training by Sir Edmund Hillary who became the first person to reach the top of Mount Everest in 1953.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Visit Snowdonia National Park, designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, steeped in culture and local history, where over half the population speak Welsh</p> <p>• Undertake this tough 20km challenge to the highest mountain in Wales</p> <p>• Start from one of Snowdon's loveliest and most picturesque villages - Beddgelert</p> <p>• See some of the old copper mine workings along the route</p> <p>• Take “Instagram worthy” selfies with the magnificent and breathtaking views from the top of the mountain</p> <p>• Admire panoramic views on a clear day of The Lake District to the North, The Peak District, Ireland to the West and the Isle of Man</p> <p>• Approx 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Join us to climb the highest mountain in England and Wales via the quietest route with sections that are almost off path and make you forget that you’re on the flanks of one of the busiest mountains in the world.</p> <p>Starting from the car park near the pretty village of Beddgelert we climb out of the Nantgwynant valley using the start of the walk identical to the Watkin Path. We quickly leave the crowds behind as we head for the seldom used but spectacular South Ridge, considered to be the hardest as it is longer and involves a section of scrambling and the final sadistic scree pull to Bwlch Main, but one of the most pleasant walks in Snowdonia.</p> <p>We cross the subsidiary summit of Allt Maenderyn (701 metres) before continuing along the Clogwyn Du (Black Cliffs) and Bwlch Main to the summit of Snowdon itself (1085 metres).</p> <p>After admiring the views from every edge of the summit and taking some photos to make this moment live forever, we initially follow the top of The Watkin path before once again leaving it to cross the summit of Y Lliwydd (898 metres) where the famous mountaineer George Mallory practiced for his 1953 Everest attempt. We then drop back down via a series of abandoned mines and waterfalls to the beginning.</p> <p>We can come across sheep, goats, cattle and birds of prey who live on Snowdon. Also, colourful alpine flowers flourish on the mountainside - the Snowdon Lily - a rare, delicate flowering plant which has grass-like leaves.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Parking For Watkin Path, postcode: LL55 4NR. The hike will start at 9am with planned end time between 5:30 and 6:30pm depending on the weather and pace. Please make sure to arrive on time as the group cannot wait for anyone who is late.</p> <p>Map of meeting point: [LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3hYeT4K\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3hYeT4K</a>)</p> <p>You will need transport to and from the start of this hike, which is outside London.

        "description": "<p>The legendary Outdooraholics \"Fourteen Sisters\" hike is back - we hike the Seven Sisters hills twice</p> <p>Come and join us for our own tough version of what is our most popular and probably the greatest coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs and a good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the Outdooraholics created \"Fourteen Sisters\" hike: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/fourteensisters\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/fourteensisters</a></p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Set yourself a real challenge - hike the legendary Seven Sisters in both directions and admire the absolutely stunning coastal views</p> <p>• 26km and 750m of ascent AND 750m descent with 16 hills to hike up and down</p> <p>• Our toughest London based hike - not for beginners or those who like a gentle pace</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Larger group size than usual for more social fun!</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We've worked hard to get people along to our the Seven Sisters hike - we run this at least twice most months and it's a breathtaking hike. We devised and created the \"Fourteen Sisters\" in 2013 with a superb route taking in the best of the Seven Sisters in both directions. It's a tough hike for experienced hikers only.</p> <p>There are iconic views on this hike and we get fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last ice age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Eastbourne. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike also takes in the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side being a magnet for those wishing to commit suicide. After finishing the Seven Sisters route, we hike back along it in the other direction offering different and equally breathtaking views as we head back to Eastbourne to our end of pub hike.</p> <p>Toughness - can I really do this?</p> <p>We're not going to deceive you, for most people this will be a tough physical challenge. We hike over about 16 hills in total during the day.</p> <p>The hike is long and will be done at a fairly brisk pace (not a stroll). It is also usually a larger group size so more social fun.</p> <p>Most people who are fit and regular hikers should be able to take on this challenge. You will have various options to leave the hike safely if needed but please do only sign up if this tough physical challenge appeals. If you have an injury or are unwell on the day, we strongly advise not taking part in this hike.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:40am for the 8:54am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.</p> <p>We meet between WHSmith (no 34) and Nero Express (no 29) - [MAP LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx</a>)</p> <p>Planned arrival time back into London is 7:36pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for the day until then)</p> <p>**Food**</p> <p>We'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

        "description": "<p>We’re off to explore a stunning and ancient bit of the Kent countryside connected with two historical figures - Sir Winston Churchill and also the social activist and co-founder of the National Trust - Octavia Hill. Both of these giant figures had a lifelong love of the outdoors and we’re going to show you why with this fantastic hike through a gorgeous part of Kent (known as the \"Garden of England\").</p> <p>We pass near by Churchill’s family home along with other historical estates such as Emmetts Garden and Tenchleys Manor. Our trail takes us through several charming villages including Crockham Hill where Octavia Hill lived and we also visit Toys Hill (235m) which has far reaching views and the site of a former vast mansion with a few reminders it was here remaining.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Visit the charming town of Oxted</p> <p>• Pass the historical Country Houses of Tenchleys Manor and Emmetts Garden</p> <p>• Pass the home of Sir Winston Churchill - Chartwell</p> <p>• Hike through Crockham Hill - the village where Octavia Hill lived and is buried</p> <p>• Visit Toys Hill - the place which inspired Octavia Hill to found the National Trust</p> <p>• Enjoy the countryside and rural beauty of Limpsfield Common and Westerham</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We start off in Oxted, a small town with pretty timber framed buildings, where the Greenwich meridian passes through the local school.

We then continue onto Crockham Hill - home to Octavia Hill where she chose to be buried. Much of the land in the area was acquired for the National Trust through Octavia's efforts.</p> <p>From the village we progress onto Chartwell to see the splendid adulthood home and garden of Sir Winston Churchill and after a short rest we move on to see the charming Chartwell farm. Following the picturesque views across the weald on Puddledock Lane, we continue on to Toys Hill (235m) - a hamlet situated on the steep scarp slope of the Greensand Ridge which inspired Octavia Hill to create the National Trust. After admiring the views from Toys Hill, we hike to Emmetts Garden - an Edwardian estate located on Ide Hill and from there we return back to Oxted passing the quaint village of Westerham.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:20am leaving the meeting point at 8:35am for the 8:50am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>England’s most beautiful and second largest lake.<br/>24 miles (39 KM), 1000 METRES OF ASCENT.</p> <p>Col is well known to the group - he is both Mountain Rescue and also a Mountain Leader and leads all of our tougher and more challenging mountain hikes.</p> <p>For 2021 we have a new trip with him and it’s fantastic! It’s slightly less tough than the “25 miles Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge, but far more stunning and picturesque, being set in the Lake District and by England’s second largest lake and many would argue the most beautiful. This is a tough 20 mile hike and with 1000m of ascent as we head up the mountains surrounding the lake for breath taking panoramic views. Let Col show you why the Lake District is considered the most stunning part of England!</p> <p>This is the place where Wordsworth saw his daffodils, where is the oldest native red deer herd in England, the most famous and most visited waterfall in the Lake District - Aira Force. With so many fantastic views, wildlife, history and villages en-route this is a great hike and also a great location with a lot of options to build your own weekend trip around this day hike.</p> <p>This trip is tough and only for fit and experienced hikers who want a tough challenge.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Approx 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Complete the full 20-miles circuit around Ullswater lake surrounded by stunning mountain scenery</p> <p>• Discover England's largest National park which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site - The Lake District</p> <p>• Spectacular high up views across Ullswater</p> <p>• See the glorious waterfalls of the famous Aira Force</p> <p>• Walk around Gowbarrow Fell and through Glencoyne and see why Wordsworth loved this area so much so he wrote his beautiful poem after a walk there</p> <p>• Visit the impressive stone circles Cockpit which original purpose still remains a mystery, and some ancient churches along the way</p> <p>• The small, pretty villages of Pooley Bridge, Glenridding, Patterdale and Howtown</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>The walk starts in Pooley Bridge, the forest path via Dunmallard Hill and heads out anticlockwise as the hill discovers a spectacular view over the lake and outlines our path ahead.</p> <p>Then we follow the grounds of Waterfoot Park, nestled in a picturesque location with beautiful views of the surrounding fells, and through the quiet woodland of Swinburn Park (one of five medieval deer parks in the past surrounding Ullswater). Before joining this track through the park we will come across the beautifully situated Watermillock Church.</p> <p>We continue our route around the side of Gowbarrow Fell (Airy Crag 481 m) to the National Trust Aira Force waterfall - not just the highlight of the Ullswater way but one of the Lake District’s gems. In the distance is Lyulph’s Tower – a sixteenth century castellated tower.<br/>From there we follow the narrow and uneven paths by the lake's shore from Glencoyne to Glenridding where we will stop for a break. Glencoyne Wood is famous for the ancient Deer park and where William Wordsworth sees his daffodils and being inspired, he wrote his most famous poem in 1802.</p> <p>The walk then goes through the village of Patterdale passing King George V playing fields – named “the prettiest field in England” by William Wordsworth, before crossing the open valley to Side Farm and following the other shore of the lake heading north with stunning views across the lake to the Helvellyn range of mountains.</p> <p>We take a narrow path towards Howtown from where we leave the lake shore and climb the last hill of Barton Fell (Arthur’s peak 532m) and explorе the impressive Cockpit Stone Circle (prehistoric monument with 27 wide stone bank) before heading back down into Pooley Bridge.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>Meeting point is outside the Post Office in Pooley Bridge which is only 6 miles (around 10 km or a 20min bus journey) from Penrith mainline train station. Meeting time - 8:45am, leaving at 9am. Postcode is CA10 2NP. Planned end time - approx 7pm. Please make sure to arrive on time as the group cannot wait for anyone late.</p> <p>For bus timetable from Penrith to Pooley Bridge click here: [LINK](<a href=\"https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/buses/508/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/buses/508/</a>)<br/>Map of meeting point: [LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3nZ2phe\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3nZ2phe</a>)</p> <p>We recommend you to arrive the night before and stay in the village of Pooley Bridge or Penrith with plenty of pubs, shops and B&amp;B’s. Because the hike often takes up to 10 hours or more, so it may be more suitable to stay another night and return the following day if you're travelling by train.</p> <p>You will need transport to and from the start of this hike, which is outside London.

Please contact people via this forum and post there if you can offer or need a lift or plan to hire a car and can offer spaces.</p> <p>**Food**</p> <p>We'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

        "description": "<p>Another superb hike in the South Downs National Park to explore the hidden gems and breathtaking views that rural England has to offer. We start our trail in the heart of rural Sussex on a route that takes in sleepy villages with thatched cottages and ancient time forgotten rural churches as we explore the Sussex Weald. We hike on ridge tops with breathtaking panoramic views and our trail leads us past an ancient hill carving and culminates on the coast!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• See the mysterious Long Man of Wilmington hill carving, which is several hundred years old</p> <p>• Visit an ancient smugglers inn</p> <p>• Visit Eastbourne - the sunniest place in Britain, which conveniently happens to be on the coast</p> <p>• Hike the famous South Downs chalk hills</p> <p>• Explore rural Sussex and its picture postcard villages that time has forgotten</p> <p>• Enjoy a well deserved rest and a drink at a coastal town after the hike</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We start off at Arlington Reservoir and we get an early glimpse of this ancient hillside figure known locally as the Long Man of Wilmington, which grows larger and larger until we're standing at its feet. Nobody knows the exact origins of the Long Man carving but it's believed to date from the 1500s or 1600s. Step by step we cross several hills that reward us with splendid panoramic views along much of our trail. As we get closer to the coast, we start sensing the alluring fresh scent of the sea air and coastal views. Our hike finishes in the coastal town of Eastbourne, which has the envious title of being the sunniest place in Great Britain. We head on to a pub as we usually do for some well deserved drinks before heading back to London.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:46am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>Summit England's highest mountain - known as the “roof of England” with sublime views into some of the Lake District’s most famous valleys.</p> <p>Join us to discover why Wainwright determined this place as: “Mecca of all weary pilgrims in Lakeland, the place of many ceremonies and celebrations, of bonfires and birthday parties, the ultimate, the supreme, the one object above all others, the highest ground in England - the top of Scafell Pike”</p> <p>Part of the famous National 3 Peaks challenge, it’s a stunning hike with far reaching views across the Lake District and out to sea, Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man can be seen on a clear day!</p> <p>It's a serious hike, being tough and steep in places. Depending on weather the route can involve scrambling over rocky terrain and requires a good fitness level and previous experience of mountain hikes</p> <p>**Trip Highlights**</p> <p>• Approx 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>• Hike up one peak of the National Three Peaks Challenge - Scafell Pike</p> <p>• See the best of The Lake District - England's largest National park</p> <p>• Explore the famous glacial Langdale valley, described by John Ruskin as “…the loveliest rock scenery, chased with silver waterfalls, that I ever set foot or heart upon”</p> <p>• Visit Angle Tarn which according to Alfred Wainwright ranks amongst the best of Lakeland tarns with its indented shore and islets. We can come across red deer here</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man Col who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>**Trip Description:**</p> <p>This is a challenging hike to the summit of the highest mountain in England, Scafell Pike (978 m).</p> <p>The beginning of the hike goes through Cumbria Way, a long distance path which crosses the county from Ulverston in the south to Carlisle in the north. In between the two it passes through some of the Lake District’s most famous and magnificent scenery with lakeshore paths and ancient green lanes.</p> <p>Then we continue with walking up Mickleden, a large glaciated valley in the shadow of a group of mountains and one of the two valleys called the Langdale Pikes which join to form Great Langdale, the other being Oxendale. Langdale is a U-shaped valley formed by glaciers, referred to by the poet Wordsworth as a “must visit valley”. Our route begins to climb up to the Rossett Pass alongside Rossett Gill via a series of wide zig-zags.</p> <p>There then follows a route past Angle Tarn (lake) and eventually, we will reach a cross shelter, built from stone in the famous Esk Hause Pass. It’s a high mountain pass from which we begin the final ascent to the summit of Scafell Pike which goes between Esk Pike and Great End, giving us time to admire the views down Eskdale, one of the Lake District’s most unspoilt valleys.</p> <p>From the top of the pass, a well-trodden route takes us up onto the high ridge of the Scafells. Once on the top we will spend some time exploring the rocky summit, the result of thousands of years of glaciation. On a clear day Scotland, the Isle of Man and even Ireland in the West can be seen.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at the National Trust Car Park next to The Stickle Barn Pub (postcode LA22 9JU) at 8:45 and leave at 9am. We will meet next to the toilets which are to the left hand side of the pub.</p> <p>Map of meeting point: [LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3KmyEOD\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3KmyEOD</a>)</p> <p>Please note there are two other local car parks, a small one on the right of the pub for guests of the pub and hotel and another on the opposite side of the main road through Langdale from The Stickle Barn. You can choose to park in any of the car parks (you may need £9 in coins) but the meeting point is as described above.</p> <p>Estimated return 6/7pm.

        "description": "<p>The latest in our series of new hikes, this is based on the old Devils Dyke hike we did in 2013, but a much improved route finishing at Shoreham on Sea.</p> <p>Our trail takes us across the South Downs along elevated tracks with superb far reaching views and both into and across chalk valleys. It’s quite a varied route with sections of woodland and for much of the time we will be high up on the South Downs Hills offering far reaching views. On our route the sea slowly gets closer until we finally hit the beach at the coastal town of Shoreham by Sea.</p> <p>Along our trail we visit the remains of the ancient Wolstonbury Hill Fort hill fort dating back around 3000 years to the Bronze Age - the Late Neolithic period.</p> <p>Please note, this hike is hilly hence the Tough rating, the ascent is approx 600/650m which is almost as much as some of our mountain hiking days.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike in the South Downs - one of the best National Parks in the South of England<br/>• Visit the remains of a Bronze Age hill fort<br/>• Hike along the ancient Devil's Dyke valley<br/>• Enjoy stunning coastal views as we approach our destination by the sea<br/>• Explore the adorable historical town and beach of Shoreham on Sea</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>We start at Hassocks and our adventure takes us up onto the South Downs ridge, traversing part of the South Downs National Park, Britain's newest National Park. A 3000 year old route takes us along the top of the chalk highlands and passes by Wolstonbury Hill, a good location for wild orchid spotting with views almost as far as London. Our trail continues further along the chalk ridges of the famous South Downs Way with superb views both inland and to the sea. We then reach the Devil's Dyke, a deep valley surrounded by steep hills - one of the best view points of the South Downs where we can see The Sussex Weald and on a clear day, the Isle of Wight. It is the site of an Iron Age hillfort, and a pub. The view is so gorgeous, that a tourist railway and station was once built here just for day trippers to admire the view</p> <p>Our next stop is Fulking Hill, an area of bowl barrows containing archaeological remains and environmental evidence relating to the way the monument was constructed and used in the Late Neolithic and the Bronze Age. We enjoy more views from the top of the slope at Truleigh Hill, picked out by its distinctive masts, with the crown of trees on Chanctonbury Ring further on.</p> <p>The South Downs reward us with yet more fantastic and far reaching panoramas as we approach the sea on our way past the tiny Shoreham airport - the oldest commercial airport in the world with a protected 1936 art deco terminal building that plays host to many films including \"The Da Vinci Code\", Agatha Christie's \"Poirot\" and \"Woman in Gold\". We finish our hike in the historic fishing town of Shoreham on Sea for a well earned drink and rest.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:45am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

        "description": "<p>Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England</p> <p>• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed</p> <p>• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike</p> <p>• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town</p> <p>• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.</p> <p>Our hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

        "description": "<p>This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.</p> <p>Join us on a challenging day hike that will lead you through the beauty of the Peak District National Park! The dramatic landscape of this area offers an inspiring abundance of rugged peaks, brooding moors and lush forests which made the Peak District the UK's first designated National park. Our route runs a part of the skyline around the picturesque Edale Valley and leads to beautiful view spots of the surroundings.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike a stunning section of the Edale Skyline - a fantastic first longer distance hike</p> <p>• Build your own weekend trip around this day hike or hop on the train from London and do it in just a day</p> <p>• See Kinder Downfall - the highest waterfall in the Peak District with a 30 metre fall</p> <p>• Enjoy a spectacular view from Ringing Roger</p> <p>• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups</p> <p>• Approx 12 to 14 attendees</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Its stunning, raw beauty, dramatic and rugged landscapes and natural charm along with picture postcard stone villages make it obvious why the Peak District is the first designated National Park in the UK AND also the second most visited National Park in the world.</p> <p>This area is a popular place to visit for all those literature fans - Hathersage village and the surroundings are associated with the outlaw Robin Hood and Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre.</p> <p>Our walk is a part of the famous Edale Skyline route and provides a beautiful scenery of wild moorland plateaus and wonderful views. We follow a dramatic route up on to the Kinder Scout plateau to over 600m high, following a stream up a narrow winding valley high onto the plateau to enjoy the spectacular views over the Edale Valley. On a clear day we can even see Sheffield and Manchester cities in the distance.</p> <p>We pass by Kinder Downfall which is the highest waterfall in the Peak District. The waterfall presents a spectacular view when its water is blown back by the strong wind forming a cloud of spray that could be seen from miles.</p> <p>The route also touches the Pennine Way - the first national trail and one of the most famous long distance footpaths in the UK. We finally get back down to Edale by hiking the Jacob’s Ladder. This last section is rocky but easy and it will once again allows us to enjoy the picturesque scenery.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet outside the Glossop Train Station building, on Norfolk Street, Glossop at the small car parking area in front of it at 9:45am, and leave at 10am to start the hike - please buy a parking ticket to cover all day if travelling here by car.</p> <p>As it's impossible to give a precise end time it's safest for train bookings to assume between 6:00pm to 7:00pm in case of delays.</p> <p>Street view of meeting point - [LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3hTGi7S\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3hTGi7S</a>)<br/>Map of meeting point: [LINK](<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Zhf7gJ\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2Zhf7gJ</a>)</p> <p>You will need transport to and from the start of this hike, which is outside London.

We finish in a picture postcard country pub for some well deserved refreshments.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike to the start of the famous Ridgeway Trail - Britain's oldest trail dating back at least 5000 years</p> <p>• Get views of the huge 147m white lion carved into the hillside at Whipsnade</p> <p>• Walk some fantastic hills in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</p> <p>• Visit the Bridgewater Monument - a 33m tall tower built in 1832 in memory of the third Duke of Bridgewater</p> <p>• Visit the tiny village of Aldbury - a picturesque setting often referred to as a ''chocolate-box'' village due to its traditional appearance</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This hike takes in both some stunning scenery and a good bit of history. We hike through beech woodland, chalk uplands and get some great views over the vale of Aldbury before leading back through the woods of the Ashridge Estate - the former home of the Dukes of Bridgewater. We then drop into the quaint and unspoilt village of Aldbury. Part of our route takes us along the ancient path of the famous Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britain's oldest road and we also pass the Bridgewater Monument - created to honour the Duke who built one of Britain's first canals.</p> <p>Ivinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\".</p> <p>For the attentive and sharp eyed a 483 foot long white lion carved into a distant chalk hill is also visible from the stunning panorama of Ivinghoe Beacon.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Euston station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:55am train.

        "description": "<p>What better than a great hike, then finishing on the famous Brighton seafront with some short time to enjoy this coastal town. On the way there, we will hike along the elevated South Downs hills, summiting Ditchling Beacon to enjoy splendid sea views and diverse countryside, as the sea gets larger and larger and eventually we'll end up on the beach at Brighton.</p> <p>We will also have some time to explore Brighton itself - wander along the famous Lanes with the sound of the buskers livening up the streets, and lose ourselves in the bars, cafe's and independent jewellery and antique shops. You can even get a zip wire experience on the seafront. We will have some time to enjoy the pebble beach, and if you're feeling really in the seaside mood, grab some good old British Fish and Chips. Join us or miss out!</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Traverse the chalk highlands of the South Downs<br/>• Summit Ditchling Beacon with far reaching views<br/>• Visit Stanmer, a charming ancient private village with medieval architecture<br/>• Explore the species-rich grassland of Whitehawk Hill<br/>• Finish at colourful Brighton and hit the beach, and for the brave - dip our toes in the sea<br/>• A great physical challenge for the fit and fast hikers</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>This is a different experience from the usual walk along the South Downs ridge. Instead, this route starts off at Hassocks and then traverses north to south exploring hidden valleys, woods, open green expanses and parkland.</p> <p>The end point is the lively town of Brighton, famous for its vibrant nightlife, and we will be rewarded with a trip to the sea at Brighton Waterfront. Before that we will pass through the cosy village of Ditchling, then stand atop Ditchling Beacon, explore the green expanse of the Stanmer Park, pass Stanmer House, then walk through the University of Sussex campus to Falmer. We will enjoy a lovely view of the sea from Kemp Town Racecourse and then walk into the splendour that is Brighton. The boardwalk, pier, seafront bars, Mediterranean cuisine and fish and chips of England's most famous beach await you!</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 8:45am leaving the meeting point at 9am for the 9:15am train.

We're off to historic Arundel in Sussex and breaking with tradition we'll also have a brief stop mid hike at a delightful little pub on the banks of the river Arun for that irresistible sneaky river side pint to satisfy the Outdoor Alcoholics.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike the chalk hills with breathtaking views to the distant sea</p> <p>• Explore the landscaped Arundel Park with its woodland, Swanbourne lake, meadows and the Gothic Hiorne Tower</p> <p>• Superb views of the 12th century Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Follow the river Arun on a picturesque trail towards Arundel Castle</p> <p>• Visit the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral (French Gothic style)</p> <p>• Riverside pub visit</p> <p>• Visit the well preserved Sussex ancient market town of Arundel</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>A delightful mix of scenery with a good stretch along the river Arun, a visit to the woods and hills of Arundel Park and the striking and extravagant castellated Hiorne tower. We'll then venture into Arundel with its Gothic and enchanting castle dominating and looming over the town to finish our hike by finding the mighty Arundel Cathedral. We'll get some far off and ever nearing views of the castle as we follow the meandering and lazy river Arun. As well as the quick mid hike pub stop we'll have our usual refreshments in Arundel before making our way back to London. We'll pop up to hike past Arundel Cathedral but sadly can't get into the grounds or very close to Arundel Castle as admission is charged.</p> <p>With just under 2500 inhabitants Arundel is a small town, but has been home to the very rich and powerful Dukes of Norfolk for over 400 years. The original Mott and Bailey castle was built on the site in 1067 by the Normans after their invasion of Britain in 1066 and has since been rebuilt and expanded to provide the grand modern day stately home. The castle is still inhabited by the Dukes of Norfolk with the 18th Duke residing there currently. Hiorne Tower was built in Arundel Park in 1787 as an extravagant folly for the Duke of Norfolk and has a commanding position high on the hills and is quite enchanting and captivating.</p> <p>**Transport &amp; Meeting Point**</p> <p>We meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:20am for the 9:35am train.

        "description": "<p>The beauty of Box Hill has inspired many great artists, writers and musicians for hundreds of years. Jane Austen based the picnic scene from ''Emma'' here, George Lambert's famous painting of Box Hill in 1733 (now in the Tate Gallery) and it's even had several songs written about it, the most recent being ''On Box Hill'' by Everything But the Girl. It also inspired the poet Keats and the writer G.K. Chesterton. Come and discover the magic of Box Hill for yourself and see why it’s attracted and inspired so many famous creatives for centuries.</p> <p>**Trip Highlights:**</p> <p>• Hike along the stunning Surrey Hills (422 km²) - a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which covers one quarter of the county of Surrey</p> <p>• See the famous Box Hill viewpoint with far reaching views over Surrey and Sussex</p> <p>• Enjoy breathtaking hiking through the woods and hills of the North Downs</p> <p>• Visit Denbies - England's largest vineyard, which has won international awards</p> <p>• See the twisting hill roads of the 2012 Olympics cycle race where the cyclists did 9 laps of this spectacular section</p> <p>**Hike Description**</p> <p>Box Hill is located on the North Downs and lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

        "description": "<p>Join us on a journey to hikers' paradise - Georgia. Nestled on the edge of Europe and Asia, it’s known as \"the Balcony of Europe\" and holds a unique mixture of diverse scenery - from the highest peaks of the continent to gentle vine clad valleys and ancient settlements. A country with ancient traditions and warm hearted people that is believed to be the birthplace of wine.</p> <p>Experience the essence of Georgia on this week long trip in the heart of the Great Caucasus Mountains. Dive into the unspoiled beauty of the Svaneti - hike to giant glaciers, admire the mesmerising alpine Koruldi lakes, and visit the highest permanently inhabited UNESCO village in Europe. We will be staying in the mountain town of Mestia that has best preserved the colourful Georgian culture and heritage and we will visit the vibrant town of Kutaisi, which is also one of the oldest towns in Europe.</p> <p>Trip Highlights:</p> <p>• Visit Georgia - the birthplace of wine and home to Europe’s highest mountain</p> <p>• Reach the highest permanently inhabited village in Europe - the ancient Ushguli</p> <p>• Hike to the magnificent Ushba waterfall - towering at 2200m above sea level</p> <p>• Hike to two mountain glaciers</p> <p>• Explore the medieval Svaneti region - a UNESCO World Heritage Site</p> <p>• Reach the base of Georgia’s highest peak at 2400m</p> <p>• Visit Kutaisi - one of the oldest towns in Europe with reminders of Russian and Ottoman conquests</p> <p>• A fine balance between hiking and culture to fully experience the magic of Georgia</p> <p>• A small group limited to just 16 with 2 English speaking local Georgian Mountain Guides to keep it really special</p> <p>Photos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics</p> <p>Holiday Description</p> <p>Mountainous, warm, colourful and vibrant is the best way to describe Georgia. Caught between two worlds, the country is a spectacular blend of European and Middle Eastern culture with immense natural diversity.</p> <p>We have chosen the spectacular UNESCO listed mountain region of Svaneti that is preserved in time due to its isolated location surrounded by the Great Caucasus Mountains. We will venture to the base of the highest peak in Georgia, admire Chalaadi and Shkhara glaciers and explore the picturesque village of Ushguli dating back to the 9th century. We'll also enjoy the reflection of the snow capped mountains in the mirror like Koruldi lakes and hike to one of the highest waterfalls in Georgia.</p> <p>Amazing Georgia keeps so many treasures that it deserves a full week to truly experience it all - hike around spectacular untouched scenery while also getting a taste of the amazing local cuisine and hospitality. Let's not forget the unique wine tradition dating 8000 years back.</p> <p>Important Notes</p> <p>Although this trip is designed as a mixture of varied hiking and sightseeing, some of the hikes involve long descents on steep ground and also some rough and uneven walking on rocks and boulders. There are some tough and long uphill/downhill sections and this trip is only suitable for hikers with experience of mountain hiking. Hiking boots ideally with ankle protection are essential due to the uneven and rocky terrain on some hikes.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Sunday 11th September</p> <p>Arrive at Kutaisi airport around midnight.

        "description": "<p>Are you ready to escape with us on this short weekend adventure to the mesmerizing Triglav National Park, hike upto Triglav summit with professional Slovenian mountain guides doing via ferrata on the way?</p> <p>Welcome to the captivating Julian Alps where we embark upon an unforgettable adventure to summit Slovenia’s highest peak - the mighty Mount Triglav (2864m). The locals claim that one is considered ‘’a true Slovenian’’ only after they have reached the peak at least once in their lifetime. You may not need to become ‘’a true Slovenian’’ but Mount Triglav is definitely worth being crossed from your bucket list as is seeing the iconic Lake Bled, which we stay nearby.</p> <p>ONLY 1 DAY OFF WORK REQUIRED - This trip is designed as a short break, perfect for fit adventurers who are keen to challenge themselves and feel the via ferrata thrill.</p> <p>Trip Highlights:</p> <p>• Climb the highest peak and symbol of Slovenia, Mount Triglav - considered a rite of passage for locals</p> <p>• Explore Triglav National Park - the only National Park in Slovenia and one of the oldest in Europe</p> <p>• Spend a night in a Mountain Hut on our journey to the summit</p> <p>• Enjoy the naturally wild and untamed nature of the Julian Alps</p> <p>• Bask on the fairytale shores and deep blue waters of the glacial Lake Bled</p> <p>• Visit Bled medieval Castle - the oldest castle in Slovenia and symbol of Bled</p> <p>• Short trip easy to be extended, should you want to stay in Bled extra days</p> <p>Photos - Most photos were taken by our guides on the trip</p> <p>Click here to join our Facebook community: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/</a></p> <p>Holiday Description</p> <p>Welcome to Slovenia - the first officially Certified Green country in the world and a not so hidden gem anymore but actually a very popular destination among tourists and more specifically among hikers wanting to conquer the epic Mount Triglav - the highest peak in the Julian Alps.</p> <p>Our journey starts from Ljubljana airport from where we will be taken by a private transfer to our accommodation in the picturesque town of Bled. Then, we will meet our hosts, check-in and have the rest of the day free to explore Bled. Do not miss out on the opportunity to visit the famous glacier Lake Bled - despite being Slovenia’s star tourist attraction, it remains unspoiled with crystal blue waters and a delightfully peaceful atmosphere. While there, do not forget the mighty Bled Castle which has been firmly standing at the top of 130 meters high steep cliff for over thousand years. Considered the oldest castles in the area, nowadays Lake Bled Castle is the most visited tourist gem that offers beautiful views of the lake and its small island, the Alpine town and the surrounding landscape with the peaks of the Julian Alps.</p> <p>On the next two days, our adventure continues. We head off to the starting point of our hike - Krma Valley and from there towards our main destination - Mount Triglav. We will go through gentle paths, thick forests and green meadows while keeping our eyes open for the huge variety of wildlife that calls this area home, including griffon vultures, golden eagles and lynx. In the afternoon, we will reach Kredarica hut where we will spend the night and gather strength for the last challenge - the last 350m via ferrata route which will finally bring us on the top of Slovenia.</p> <p>Important Notes</p> <p>The hike is tough and a challenging activity with a demanding climb to the summit of the mountain. It also requires a high level of endurance and can be challenging for those, who are not used to longer hikes. The climb to the summit of Mt. Triglav is via ferrata, which is an extremely steep climb on steel ladders and steel wires and is not recommended for people, who are not in a good physical condition or are afraid of heights. You need to be of above average fitness for this trip and a regular hiker, used to tough mountains. If you have any doubts, please email us before signing up.</p> <p>ITINERARY</p> <p>Friday 16th September</p> <p>Our private transfer will pick you up from Ljubljana Airport and take you to your lovely accommodation in Bled.
