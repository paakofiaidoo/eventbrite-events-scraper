        "description": "The curious and fascinating area of Farringdon is right on the fringe of the City with some FANTASTIC pubs dotted about, many of which close at weekends as they cater mainly to weekday trade… We'll leave Farringdon tube at 7.30pm meeting by the main entrance. First stop is the Old Mitre, there's no chance you'll find this without a guide it's VERY well hidden! We'll cut through Bleeding Heart yard and maybe take a meander through the jewellery quarter at Hatton Gardens before stopping off at the 250 year old pub The Old Tun on Saffron Hill, patronised by Charles Dickens between1833 and 1838. From there we'll pass by the Jerusalem tavern, one of the most exquisite small pubs in London. This tiny old pub may be a bit of a squeeze for us so we'll quickly move off to the more spacious Crown Tavern on Clerkenwell Green, where Lenin and Stalin are said to have met in 1905. If anyone has the stamina we may hop across the road to the rather funky Three Kings. Finishing at Clerkenwell Green we'll be a short walk from Farringdon tube, a slightly longer walk through Clerkenwell takes you to Angel tube. We'll supply you with maps should you wish to split from the main group and enjoy your pint at more leisure, and to help you find your way home after.\n\nDue to the small size of some of the pubs, we're very limited for numbers on this, so don't delay if you wish to come.\n\nRefunds are not available. If you're subsequently unable to come, please post on the event page or message people on the waiting list directly.\n\nUpdate 13th March: Sophie will have the group phone, but it's likely with lack of reception in pubs and noise it may be hard/not possible to get us on it. It's strongly advisable to try to make the start!",

        "description": "Update for those meeting at Watreloo 26th March:\n\nUnfortunately Sophie is very unwell with a bad cold so wont be able to meet people at Waterloo tomorrow. Our other two assistants aren't able to make it tomorrow either, so a slight change of plans for those leaving from our Waterloo meeting point...\n\nI suggest you all still meet under the main clock at 9:30 to get your Group4Save tickets and then return there as a group and wait until 9:50. At 9:50 please make your way to the train. We're on the 10:00 train destination Portsmouth Harbour and you'll need to get off at Guildford at 11:10. You need to be on this train to make the walk, so being at Waterloo at 9:30 is strongly advisable. You can see the departures board from the meeting point and the departing platform will be shown on there.\n\nSo, in essence you'll need to get your tickets (Group4save with 3 others if you can) and get on the train yourself. I hope this is okay for anyone - any questions drop me an email and I'll reply tonight:\n\noutdooraholics@gmail.com\n\nPlease note: This is a longer and more demanding walk than our trips so far. Please check below for details. Also please note the clocks will have gone an hour forward last night!\n\nOnce in Guildford we’ll walk along the picturesque River Wey canal, past the boat houses and rowing boats and then onto the Bluebell Woods where we’ll join the North Downs Way ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we’ll come to St Martha’s church (where a church has stood since Saxon times). From here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see eight counties from this point. We’ll then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory since 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now a semi derelict ruined site covering 27 acres.\n\nPart of our route will also follow \"The Pilgrims Way\" an ancient trading route with mainland Europe that goes down to Canterbury and dates back at least 2500 years.\n\nDuring the Second World War the North Downs way was partially fortified to defend against a German invasion force reaching London and there are still a few pillboxes, tank traps and obstacles, air raid bunkers and gun placements to be seen today for the keen eyed.\n\nWe'll have a lunch stop at St Marthas church, so bring some food\n\nWe should be back into Guildford for about 5/6pm where we’ll visit a pub for some food and drink before embarking on the train back to London.\n\nMeeting:\n\nWaterloo:\nPlease see note above...\n\nBelow is a photo of the clock - it's easy to find:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/preamble/291777194/\n\nFurther details (plus terms) of Group4Save can be found at:\nhttp://www.daysoutgui...\n\nGuildford:\n\nFor those making their own way, Graham will be at the main entrance to Guildford station and please be there for 11.\n\nLatecomers: Once in Guildford it's a complicated route, so it wont be possible for any latecomers who miss the train to catch up and having had a 30 minute wait at Waterloo and an hours train journey, the group wont be waiting for any latecomers at Guildford.\n\nDistance\nThe walk is approximately 10 to 11 miles and will involve walking across gravel, sand, mud and a few fair ascents and descents so hiking boots are strongly recommended. Whilst it wont be a race, we need to keep up a reasonable pace to ensure we're back before dark so this walk is only for those who are confident in their abilities and fitness for covering 10/11 miles including several hills at a decent pace.\n\nCost\nThere is a £2 charge per person to be collected on the day\n\nWhat to bring:\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots (part of the route is sandy and there might be mud\nWater\nPacked lunch\nMoney for pub and food later on\n\nCamera advisable as there are some good photo opportunities\n\nWeather: If the weather looks bad this Meetup will be postponed with a couple of days notice.",

A nice walk passing Cumberland Lodge, the Obelisk, crossing over Virginia Water and taking us back into Windsor via the Castle where there's a good selection of pubs. It also gives a chance for those wishing to go early to explore Windsor or possibly visit the Castle. About a third of the walk does cover the same track going back and this is unavoidable (the Long Walk straight).\n\nThis is a LONG WALK, please see below before signing up\n\nTransport:\n\nWe will be meeting at Windsor and Eton Central station at 11:45 and leaving at 12:00. For those in central London, the train from Paddington to Slough and then change at Slough to Windsor and Eton Central Station is suggested. Approx 43-45 minutes\n\nThe 11:15 from Paddington gets to Windsor at 11:58 and we will wait for this train to arrive before leaving. Please note there are two stations in Windsor so be careful to get yourself to the correct one - Windsor and Eton Central.\n\nDifficulty\n\nApprox 13 miles at a decent pace\n\nWe aim to cover this in about 5 hours of walking. This is a reasonably long distance for many people and please ensure you are comfortable covering this distance at a decent pace. If you're unsure or haven't been walking this sort of distance recently, this is probably a walk to miss\n\nFood\n\nWe'll be going to a pub after the walk for food and drink and I've reserved an area, but it's advisable to eat before the walk and bring a snack and sufficient water. We're likely to have a snack stop on the walk and hopefully enjoy the weather\n\nCost\n\nThis event is £3 per head.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots\n\nWater (strongly advised)\n\nA snack or food for the walk\n\nMoney for pub and food later on\n\nCamera\n\nSun cream and a hat or head protection\n\nPlease note: If the weather looks bad this Meetup will be postponed with a couple of days notice.",

It was well organised with food being provided on board for breakfast, lunch and a couple of dinners. Steve has a vast experience of sailing including I believe crossing the Atlantic and running up to a dozen sailing trips a year both in the UK and further afield in places like the Greek islands.\n\nPlease get in touch with Steve directly if you're interested in this trip.\n\nAdditional details:\n\nCost should be in the range £165 - £190 for 4 days sailing\ndepending on numbers and size of boat.\nThis is a discounted cost for the Bank Holiday as normally a two day sailing weekend\nwould be £140 - £175.\nThis includes mooring fees and fuel.\n\nAccomodation is on the yacht in shared cabins which are quite comfortable.\nThe marinas we go to have good facilities.\nDepending on where everyone comes from we often try and car share where possible\nor travel down in groups on the train.\nFood and drink consumed on the boat i.e. breakfasts, lunches and evening meals we usually start a kitty, not expected to be more\nthan £30 each.\nQuite good value as it includes an ample supply of beers ,wines, Gin & Tonics etc.\nThere are also nice places to go for walks in between the sailing.\n\nThings to bring:\n\nSleeping bag or blanket.\nPillow, or something to use as one.\nGloves to protect hands on ropes.\nSunglasses.\nSuncream,\nSun hat or cap\nTowel and toiletries etc.\nSoft soled shoes i.e. trainers or deck shoes not anything\nthat will mark the boat.\n\nIf bad weather bring wetproof clothes (hopefully not) otherwise:\n(waterproofs, and boots can be hired for low cost)\nOilskins (£10 per day)\nSea Boots (£2.50 per day)\n\n(We tend to go as we are/casual in the evening).\nPlease bring your belongings in a soft squashable\nbag i.e. holdall that is easy to stow.\nThe yachts have CD players if you want to bring CD's.\n\nThe yacht is ours from Thursday 16:00 but if ready we often can get aboard earlier.\nI will get there from midday Thursday to sort out the boat so you can arrive anytime\nfrom then.\nWe are not sailing until Friday morning so most tend to get there later after work\nso you can stow your things and chill out in the marina or the pretty Hamble village.\nDeparting Friday morning after I've given a safety briefing and familiarized\neveryone with the boat.\n\nLocation Fairview Sailing\nSatchell Lane\nPort Hamble Marina\nMarina Drive - off\nSO31 4QD\n\nM3\nM27 (East)\nTurn off at junc 8 for B3397\nThis leads into Hamble.\nAt the end of the road in the village,\nTurn left into Satchell Lane at a small roundabout.\nTurn right into Marina Drive.\nContinue into car park.\n\nIf coming by train – Waterloo – Southampton Central – Hamble.\nHamble station is a long walk from the marina and there isn’t a taxi rank outside as it is in the middle of nowhere.\nSo you need to order a cab from Hamble Station to Port Hamble Marina when you are on the connection from Southampton.\nSouthampton – Hamble takes about 15 mins.\n\nThe local cab number is 07004444444.\n\nAn alternative is to get off at Southampton Airport Parkway and get a longer cab ride to Hamble to avoid the interchange at Southampton.\n\nCall me when you arrive.\nMy mobile is 07973429645\nI will be either on the yacht or in the Whyte Hart Pub in the village.\n\nAny problems let me know.\nSteve\n\nSailing Organiser, RYA/MCA Coastal Skipper.",

        "description": "Please note: This is a longer and more demanding walk than most of our trips so far. Please check below for details.\n\nOnce in Guildford we’ll walk along the picturesque River Wey canal, past the boat houses and rowing boats and then onto the Bluebell Woods where we’ll join the North Downs Way ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we’ll come to St Martha’s church (where a church has stood since Saxon times). From here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see eight counties from this point. We’ll then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory since 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now a semi derelict ruined site covering 27 acres.\n\nMeeting:\n\nThe meeting point is Guildford station at 11:30 and we'll leave at 11:45. For those coming from Waterloo I suggest getting the 11:00 train to Guildford (destination Portsmouth Harbour) which arrives at 11:40. We'll wait for this train to arrive before leaving.\n\nFor those coming from Waterloo and wishing to take advantage of the Group4Save tickets (half price) you may wish to meet under the main clock at 10:30 and get yourselves into groups of 4 to go and buy tickets. You can see the departures board from the meeting point and the departing platform will be shown on there.\n\nBelow is a photo of the clock - it's easy to find:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/preamble/291777194/\n\nFurther details (plus terms) of Group4Save can be found at:\nhttp://www.daysoutgui...\n\nFood\n\nWe'll stop about half way through the walk at the stunning spot of St Martha's church on the hill so please bring a snack/picnic. We should be back into Guildford for about 5:30/6pm where we’ll visit a pub for some food and drink before embarking on the train back to London. I've reserved us our own corner and they do reasonably priced food and drink.\n\nDistance\n\nThe walk is approximately 10 to 11 miles and will involve walking across gravel, sand, mud and a few fair ascents and descents so hiking boots are strongly recommended. Whilst it wont be a race, we need to keep up a reasonable pace to ensure we're back before dark so this walk is only for those who are confident in their abilities and fitness for covering 10/11 miles including several hills at a decent pace.\n\nCost\nThere is a £4 charge per person to be collected on the day\n\nWhat to bring:\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots (part of the route is sandy and there might be mud)\nWater\nPacked lunch/picnic\nMoney for pub and food later on\nSun lotion/hat\n\nCamera advisable as there are some great photo opportunities\n\nWeather: If the weather looks bad this Meetup will be postponed with a couple of days notice.\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/3/c/event_22283868.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/4/7/event_22283879.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/0/event_22327072.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/d/4/event_22327124.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/6/8/event_22283912.jpeg",

This is one of the most challenging walks within close reach of London. We'll take the train to Seaford and walk from there to the elegant seafront town of Eastbourne where we'll get the train back to London around 7pm, getting back into London for around 8.30pm. Food will be available at a cafe stop mid-afternoon but you should bring lunch with you. We recommend bringing drinks for the walk and some refreshments such as energy bars.\n\nThis is a fairly challenging walk so please make sure you have decent footwear, ideally walking boots.\n\nCost:\n\nExpected cost: £18 per person includes return train tickets from Victoria.\n\nPayment in advance via PayPal\n\nRefunds and train times:\n\nPlease note: We are buying the train tickets in advance and they are only valid on that particular train and time. As we're purchasing tickets in advance, REFUNDS are not available once you've paid, although you're free to post on the message board if you wish to try to sell it on.\n\nMeeting up\n\nIf you've managed to get a space on this popular walk, please meet at 08.55 on Saturday at Victoria mainline train station to get the train to Seaford (changing at Lewes). The meeting point is by the entrance to Platform 14. Sophie will give you your train tickets there.\n\nPlease call don't text! This number is only available on the day itself.\n\nReturn\n\nWe'll return to London Victoria by 20.40.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\n- really good walking boots: remember this is a demanding walk\n\n- a packed lunch (we'll also stop at a cafe round 3pm)\n\n- plenty of water\n\n- cash for anything you want in the cafe or a drink in the pub afterwards\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/5/4/event_21606484.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/5/6/event_21606486.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/9/5/8/event_21606488.jpeg",

This event is definitely going ahead, but bring something to sit on as the ground may be damp. See you tomorrow!\n\nJohn & Graham\n\nWhere: Hyde Park within a 200 metre radius of Speakers Corner. Look for the net.\n\nTube: Marble Arch is 2 minutes away.\nIt's not just volleyball, but a mix of summer sports including frisbee, reading the Sunday Papers and sunbathing! So its designed to suit everyone and is fun, not competitive. Beginers welcome. The teams are mixed, the games quite short, so just play if and when you want. If you prefer, just sit and chat. I will supply all the sports equipment and teach any new players. There are also toilets and a cafe 100 metres away.\nLater, we usually go to a local pub where you can order food and have a drink.\nThere is no charge for this event\n\nJohn\n\nNote from Graham:\nJohn is a vey active sportman and has been running volleyball and sports afternoons in Hyde Park for many years and the photo shown on this event is from one last summer which I attended. They're good fun and all standards of players are welcome including newbies. Any questions to John directly please\n\nNumbers: This is our first big summer \"games in the park\" afternoon and to ensure nobody misses out we're not restricting numbers for this, so the turnout may well be into three figures!\n\nFinding us:\nLook for the two volleyball nets and large group of people about 200m from Speakers corner.\n\nWeather:\n\nIf the weather is looking bad (wet) this event will be postponed.",

        "description": "Farnham, Waverley Abbey and the Bourne and Tilford Woods\n\nFor those who came to Windsor and Guildford, we have yet another rural walk into the depths of Surrey which I'd like to think surpasses both. An area I know well, having grown up here and mis-spent many childhood years getting upto more antics than I'd care to admit to!\n\nA glorious circular walk from Farnham steeped in history. We'll go via Mother Ludlam's cave, Moor Park House, Waverley Abbey (founded 1128), Waverley Abbey House, the famous cricket Green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the river Wey and two ancient stone bridges and then onto the Tilford and Bourne Woods. The Bourne Woods was used for much of the filming of Gladiator. After the walk we'll head onto a pub in Farnham for a well earnt pint and some food. Farnham itself is a well preserved Georgian market town and if there's enough interest at the end I'd be happy to do a brief tour of the town and head upto the castle.\n\nDistance:\n\n10 miles, fairly flat, we should cover this in about 5 hours with an afternoon picnic stop. Please ensure you're happy with this distance and keeping up a good pace. We'll walk on gravel, sand and it may be muddy in places.\n\nCost:\n\nThe walk will be £5 per person\n\nTransport:\n\nYou will need to buy your own train ticket, but from Waterloo this costs approx £15.00 If you team up with 3 others on a Group4save it should be £7.50 return! The meeting point will be Farnham station outside the main entrance at 11:00 and we'll be leaving at 11:15 prompt when the Waterloo train arrives. Farnham is about an hour from Waterloo on a direct line, passing through some lovely countryside.\n\nFor those coming from Waterloo and wishing to take advantage of South West Trains 4 tickets for 2 offer, I'd suggest you could meet under the central Waterloo clock at 9:40:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/preamble/291777194/ http://img1.meetupstatic.com/img/clear.gif\n\n10:07 London Waterloo to Woking arriving 11:13\n\nFor those coming from Waterloo, cross over the platforms at Farnham via the bridge and go through the main station exit.\n\nSafety note:\n\nWe will be crossing various lanes and a couple of roads and there's a stretch where we need to walk on a road for about 30 metres without a pavement. Please take care and ensure you do these safely.\n\nLunch:\n\nWe will stop for lunch in the countryside for about 45 minutes. Please bring some suitable food or snacks with you.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots (the path may be muddy if wet)\n\nWater (strongly advised)\n\nFood for en route\n\nMoney for pub and dinner later on\n\nSun lotion (just in case...)\n\nWeather: If the weather looks bad this Meetup will be postponed with a couple of days notice.\n\nRSVPs will close 9pm the night before\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/3/7/event_22636439.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/4/e/event_22636462.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/5/a/event_22636474.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/5/f/event_22636479.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/6/4/event_22636484.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/7/d/event_22636509.jpeg",

It will follow the same format; I will supply the sports equipment including volleyball, Frisbee, touch rugby and possibly rounders. It’s all fun with mixed teams of all abilities. If you haven’t played before, no problem; we can teach you.\n\nOn the other hand half of the people last time concentrated on the “sports” of sunbathing, reading the Sunday papers, chatting and having a picnic. So this should appeal to everyone. There is a café and toilets close by. Later on we can again go to our local pub (5 minutes away) where you can order food and drinks if you wish.\n\nJohn\n\nNote from Graham: Please email John directly with any queries. John has organised these sports days for I believe nearly a decade in Hyde Park and they're thoroughly enjoyable and very inclusive for players of all abilities. In addition John is a most welcoming and friendly organiser. There's been huge demand for the last one John did with the group and I'm hoping that John has the time to organise this for the group as a regular event throughout the summer.

See you Sunday.\n\nGraham\n\nThe first time we did this walk in March, there was a substantial waiting list of people who couldn't make it, plus it's a great walk, so I'm repeating it again. It'll also be a nice change from our recent further afield walks for those who are based in London.\n\nTackling another stretch of the Thames - a pleasant 8 mile walk and of course completely flat.

We'll then wander past Teddington Lock after which the Thames is no longer tidal, then past Kingston onto the captivating Hampton Court.

It should take 3 to 4 hours if we keep up a decent pace. Please ensure you're happy with this distance and walking at a good pace\n\nCost\nThis walk will be £5 to be collected on the day.

In summary, because of another change by TFL (Tube works), we will now meet at Loughton Station which is a little closer to Woodford than Theydon Bois. Meeting time is still 1-30pm.\n\nTRAVEL UPDATE:\n\nTransport for London have decided to put some engineering works on the Central Line that day. But it is not too bad at all. If you travel to Woodford, you can get the specially laid on free buses to Theydon Bois Station. It is only 3 stops. Please allow an extra 30 minutes. Returning to London there are also free buses to Woodford and it is only 2 stops back. I will keep you informed of any further updates.\n\nDate: 26th June 2011\n\nTime: 1-30pm\n\nWhere: Outside Loughton Tube Station\n\nNearest Tube: Loughton on the Central Line\n\nCost: £5 per person\n\nEvent Host: John Pullen 07949-178 034\n\nEpping Forest is the largest public open space in the London area covering almost 6,000 acres. It stretches over 12 miles from Manor Park in East London to just north of Epping in Essex. Over two thirds of it has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation.\n\nBut more than that, it is an ancient forest with associations to Royal Kings and Queens who hunted there. Much earlier, it was home to Iron Age inhabitants and there are two locations where we know there was a camp. On this walk we will find one of them. It is the place of legends, haunting and murders, both old and new.\n\nDuring the walk I will tell you more about these stories. It is not a difficult walk or even one of the longest. But we will be going deep into parts of it, so don’t go off on your own or you might become the next story! Halfway through we will be stopping at a pub with views of the countryside, a beer garden, an ice cream shop and a swimming pool. Most of the time we will keep to hacking trails but it can get very muddy in places.\n\nAt the end, about 5-30pm, we will be in Loughton where there are a number of pubs and a Central Line Tube Station. A Zone 6 return ticket will cover your trip out from London.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots.\nWater\nSnacks for en route\nMoney for pub and dinner later on\nSun lotion (just in case...)\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/c/b/event_27474731.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/d/f/event_27474751.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/5/f/3/event_27474771.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/0/7/event_27474791.jpeg",

        "description": "DESCRIPTION\n\nHaving done a few walks on the North Downs we're now going to the South Downs. The landscape of the Devils Dyke was formed during the last ice age and is very dramatic. In fact, the great landscape painter Constable called the view of the wield up there \"the best in all the land\". It's also the deepest dry valley in the UK and being about 7 miles from the sea, there are some sea views to be had.\n\nI've extended the standard Devil's Dyke walk to take us further along the ridge and out to Edburton Hill and Beeding Hill and back past the village of Fulking. We'll also be getting the bus from Brighton station to the walk start and back again. On this route the bus should be an open top double decker! We'll stop on the walk for a snack/picnic lunch en route, so please bring some food.\n\nAt the end of the day it would be a shame not to spend some time in Brighton so I'll purchase train tickets to give about 3 hours in Brighton to see the waterfront, have a wander and then visit a pub and get some dinner. You're welcome to go off and explore Brighton on your own if you wish to.\n\nDifficulty:\n\n11 miles - with some climbs, expected to be 4 hours of walking (plus 1 hour for the picnic stop). Please ensure you're happy with keeping up a reasonable pace over this distance\n\nCost:\n\nThe walk will be £16 per person which includes both the return train fare from London Victoria and also the return bus fare from Brighton to the Devils Dyke (should be an open top bus).\n\nRefunds and train times:\n\nPlease note: We are buying the train tickets in advance and they are only valid on that particular train and time. As we're purchasing tickets in advance, REFUNDS are not available once you've paid, although you're free to post on the message board if you wish to try to sell your space on.\n\nTrain times:\n\nWe'll meet at Victoria at 8:45 where you can grab a coffee and we'll leave the meeting spot at 8:55 prompt for the 9:06 train. Please note: The tickets are only valid on this train, so you need to be on time.\n\nWe'll meet in front of WHSmith (no 34) and between this and the stall labelled on the map \"A Piece of Cake\" no 29 (note, it's now actually become \"Bread Box\" at the station):\n\nhttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/For%20Passengers/Station%20Maps/4510_Victoria%20Station%20Map.pdf\n\nReturn time to Victoria: 8:40pm\n\nFood and drink:\n\nWe'll stop on the walk for a picnic, so please bring some picnic bits.\n\nWe'll also go to a pub in Brighton at the end for food and drinks\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots. Some of the paths are loose gravel and without sturdy footwear you risk slipping.\nWater (essential, as this walk's long!)\nFood for en route\nMoney for pub and dinner later on\nSun lotion (just in case...)\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/3/d/f/event_31301951.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/e/b/event_31302731.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/4/9/5/event_32113461.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/1/b/event_32113851.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/5/b/event_32114171.jpeg",

We're aiming to get a small party together to enjoy this evening and possibly repair to a good pub (probably The Speaker) afterwards if people are keen. Because this event starts early, I'll probably mail your tickets to you so you can join us inside. The ticket price includes Paypal's fee and the cost of postage.\n\nThe garden party is a popular event so please book early!\n\nThe venue\nThe College Garden at Westminster Abbey occupies a site that has been under continuous cultivation for more than 900 years. It was originally established in the eleventh-century to grow herbs, fruit and vegetables and give convalescing monks a place in the open air for relaxation and gentle exercise. Now open to the public, the site looks more like a Victorian garden but with a surviving 14th century wall.\nhttp://www.westminster-abbey.org/venue-bookings/venues/college-garden\n\nThe charity\nThe Passage homeless charity helps around 200 rough sleepers each day and has excellent 'back to work' resources including a computer room where clients can receive help to write a CV. It's an excellent charity supporting those in Central London most in need to help.\nhttp://www.passage.org.uk/\n\n.Afterwards….\nThis event is from 5.30pm onwards with food served until 7.45pm. Whilst I do not expect it to end very late, if Outdooraholics are keen I suggest we might repair to a pub afterwards!\n\nNearest tube: Westminster\n\nContact details\nYou can call Sophie on 07909 564197. This number will be available a few hours before the event.\n\nMeeting up inside the event\nPlease bring your ticket to get into the event. To meet up with the event organiser Sophie inside the venue, please call 07909 564197. Sophie will be carrying a pink shoulder bag and will be with a small group.",

The forecast currently looks good for Sunday, but whatever the weather, this walk will go ahead - rain or shine.\n\nThis is the groups first walk to be put on by popular demand. Come and join us for a superb circular walk up onto the Chiltern Hills leading towards the beauty spot of Ivinghoe Beacon.\n\nThis walk both takes in some stunning scenery and a good bit of history. We'll be walking through beech woodland, chalk uplands and get some great views over the vale of Aldbury before leading back through the woods of the Ashridge Estate - the former home of the Dukes of Bridgewater. We'll then drop into the quaint village of Aldbury. Part of our route will take us along the ancient path of the Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britains oldest road and we shall also pass the Bridgewater monument - created to honour a Duke who built one of Britains first canals.\n\nIvinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\"\n\nDifficulty & distance:\n\n9 miles with some hills. Moderate\n\nCost:\n\nThe walk will be £5 per person\n\nTransport:\n\nThe meeting point is Tring Station, but those coming from London may with to get together to arrange a Group4Save ticket from Euston. THis will cost approximately £6.65 if you find three other people to purchase with. For those meeting at Euston, I'd suggest meeting in front of the main ticekt office at 10:30am and taking the 10:53 train to Tring (arriving 11:29):\n\nhttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/For%20Passengers/Station%20Maps/4500_Euston%20Station%20Map.pdf\n\nFor those coming directly to Tring we'll meet at 11:20 and leave at 11:30 when the Euston train has arrived.\n\nFood and drink:\n\nWe'll have a picnic stop on the walk so please bring some food and drink for this and we'll also visit a pub at the end so bring some money for food and drink.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots.

A nice walk passing Cumberland Lodge, the Obelisk, crossing over Virginia Water and taking us back into Windsor via the Castle where there's a good selection of pubs. It also gives a chance for those wishing to go early to explore Windsor or possibly visit the Castle. About a third of the walk does cover the same track going back and this is unavoidable (the Long Walk straight).\n\nThis is a LONG WALK, please see below before signing up\n\nTransport:\n\nWe will be meeting at Windsor and Eton Central station at 12:45 and leaving at 1:00pm. For those in central London, the train from Paddington to Slough and then change at Slough to Windsor and Eton Central Station is suggested. Approx 43-45 minutes\n\nThe 12:15 from Paddington gets to Windsor at 12:58 and we will wait for this train to arrive before leaving. Please note there are two stations in Windsor so be careful to get yourself to the correct one - Windsor and Eton Central.\n\nDifficulty\n\nApprox 13 miles at a decent pace\n\nWe aim to cover this in about 5 hours of walking. This is a reasonably long distance for many people and please ensure you are comfortable covering this distance at a decent pace. If you're unsure or haven't been walking this sort of distance recently, this is probably a walk to miss\n\nFood\n\nWe'll be going to a pub after the walk for food and drink and I've reserved an area, but it's advisable to eat before the walk and bring a snack and sufficient water. We're likely to have a snack stop on the walk and hopefully enjoy the weather\n\nCost\n\nThis event is £5 per head to be collected on the day.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots\n\nWater (strongly advised)\n\nA snack or food for the walk\n\nMoney for pub and food later on\n\nCamera\n\nSun cream and a hat or head protection\n\nPlease note: If the weather looks bad this Meetup may be postponed.\n\nPhotos from a previous trip here:\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/6/9/event_40148041.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/9/b/event_40148091.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/c/3/event_40148131.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/2/7/event_40148231.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/4/5/event_40148261.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/d/b/event_40148411.jpeg",

This is a charitable event that I intend to run annually and there are only two purposes of this event - to have a fun and enjoyable afternoon but also more importantly to raise money for a very worthwhile charity, as anyone who's been off exploring Cambodia will be able to relate to!\n\nDistance: Approx 3 miles\n\nMeeting point:\nDue to the expected size of the turnout, we'll meet outside the front of the Royal Albert Hall (the other side to Hyde Park). This is just over half a mile from South Kensington tube station\n\nCost:\nThere is a £5 donation required for this walk and to ensure the donations are paid directly and are transparent we've set up a giving page. Virgin Money giving is non profit making and is similar to Just Giving but more beneficial to the charities. If you'd like to come please ensure you've made your £5 donation on the site before signing up for this event and use your Meetup name. This event is being put up onto various other Meetup groups, so a very large turnout is expected!\n\nPlease print out your Paypal receipt for the donation and bring a copy along with you on the day\n\nWe look forward to meeting you and don't forget to bring a picnic and rug!\n\nDonation page: http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/outdooraholics\n\nP.S.

Risk of sunburn\nPlease ensure you wear and bring sun lotion and perhaps a hat or similar. We'll be out in the sun for about 4 to 5 hours which is enough to burn even in October\n\n2. Heat\nIt's going to be hot and we've a few hills to walk up, so light trousers and layers that can be removed are advisable to keep cool\n\n3. Dehydration\nAgain, with the heat and hills, water is essential and we wont have the chance to buy any on the walk. I'd suggest a minimum of 1 litre per person and more if you think you may need it.\n\nOn the plus side, it looks set to be great weather for our last \"summer?\" walk of 2011!\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/forecast/4287?&search=haslemere&itemsPerPage=10&region=world&area=Haslemere\n\nSee you tomorrow,\n\nGraham\n\nDevil's Punchbowl, Haslemere\n\nA return to yet another part of Surrey that I know from my childhood days. The picturesque National Trust Devil's Punchbowl. With it's steep sides, the punchbowl has become a natural nature reserve with woodland, heathland and a stream running through it. We will also visit Gibbets Hill which has far reaching views across Surrey. The whole area has just become that bit more peaceful and beautiful now that the nearby A3 dual carriageway has closed a month ago and the road is being reinstated to heathland.\n\nDistance:\n\n9 miles/15 kms\nExpected to be 3 to 4 hours of walking (plus 1 hour for the picnic stop). Please ensure you're happy with keeping up a reasonable pace over this distance\n\nCost:\n\nThe walk will be £5 per person (pay on the day) for the first 20 spaces and then £5.50 by Paypal in advance for the remaining spaces.\n\nTransport:\n\nYou will need to buy your own train ticket, but from Waterloo this costs approx £18.20 If you team up with 3 others on a Group4save it should be £9.10 return!

        "description": "Come and join us for a stunning walk and the last one we'll do of 2011 before the clocks change and our days shorten.\n\nMy own personal favourite from our collection of walks. Come and appreciate the autumnal colours on what is a glorious trek through some surprising and diverse countryside.\n\nOnce in Guildford we’ll walk along the picturesque River Wey canal, past the boat houses and rowing boats and then onto the Bluebell Woods where we’ll join the ancient North Downs Way path along a ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we’ll come to St Martha’s church (where a church has stood since Saxon times). From here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see eight counties from this point. We’ll then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory since 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now an enchanting derelict site covering 27 acres.\n\nMeeting:\n\nThe meeting point is Guildford station at 11:00 and we'll leave at 11:15 prompt. For those coming from Waterloo I suggest getting the 10:30 train to Guildford (destination Portsmouth Harbour) which arrives at 11:10. We'll wait for this train to arrive before leaving.\n\nFor those coming from Waterloo and wishing to take advantage of the Group4Save tickets (half price) you may wish to meet under the main clock at 10:00 and get yourselves into groups of 4 to go and buy tickets. You can see the departures board from the meeting point and the departing platform will be shown on there.\n\nBelow is a photo of the clock - it's easy to find:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/preamble/291777194/\n\nFurther details (plus terms) of Group4Save can be found at:\nhttp://www.daysoutgui...\n\nFood\n\nWe'll stop about half way through the walk at the stunning spot of St Martha's church on the hill so please bring a snack lunch. We should be back into Guildford for about 4:30/5pm where we’ll visit a pub for some food and drink before embarking on the train back to London. I've reserved us our own corner and they do reasonably priced food and drink.\n\nDistance\n\nThe walk is 9 miles and will involve walking across gravel, sand, possibly mud and a few fair ascents and descents so hiking boots are strongly recommended. Whilst it wont be a race, please ensure you're happy keeping up a reasonable pace over this distance to ensure we're back before sunset at 5:51pm\n\nCost:\n\nThe walk will be £6 per person (pay on the day) for the first 20 spaces and then £6.50 by Paypal in advance for the remaining spaces.\n\nWhat to bring:\nAppropriate walking clothes and hiking boots (part of the route is sandy and there might be mud)\nWater\nPacked lunch/picnic\nMoney for pub and food later on\nSun lotion/hat (the eternal optimist???)\n\nCamera advisable as there are some great photo opportunities\n\nSome shots from our previous trip:\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/3/c/event_22283868.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/4/7/event_22283879.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/a/0/event_22327072.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/d/4/event_22327124.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/d/6/8/event_22283912.jpeg",

A delightful rural walk which amongst other things will take us past two castles – Eynsford castle and Lullingstone castle and along a stretch of the river Darwent.\n\nAlong the way there will be some gorgeous countryside, rolling fields and we'll pass a couple of woods and rural villages too as well as some far stretching hill top views. In fact, the area’s beauty has attracted people back to Roman times and in 80AD Lullingstone Villa was constructed for a wealthy Roman who was keen on pagan worship.\n\nPlease note this walk does have two fairly steep uphill sections and can be muddy when wet, so appropriate hiking footwear is advised and a reasonable level of fitness.\n\nNumbers:\n\nThis walk will be limited to a maximum of 32 people\n\nTransport:\n\nWe'll meet at Victoria station at 9:20 where you can grab a coffee and we'll leave the meeting spot at 9:35 prompt for the 9:46 train.

Please ensure you wrap up well - gloves and hat advisable although we will shorten our lunch picnic stop to about 15 mins. It's going to be very cold especially at the start!

You will only have a confirmed place once you've paid Masi.\n\nSpaces: As at 31st January there are 5 attending and only three spaces left\n\nGraham\n\nAre you feeling the urge? I am! Lets go sailing in the sun again! Alicante is hot! Full Price £195, Return flights are around £135(skyscanner.net) and are not included. Arriving Thursday 16th night, returning Sunday 19th evening. (also possible to arrive Friday 17th early flight morning)\n\nI'm organizing a 3 day and 3 nights on board trip on a 4 double cabin yacht, 44 foot, fully coded and insured charter boat. As skipper a commercially endorsed Yachmaster. As usual, serious fun with security and safety in mind. This trip is also perfect for novices as you will be in professional hands and will have the chance to securely learn about this fantastic sport.\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/7/d/event_32248541.jpeg\n\nAlicante is the Little Barcelona of the south East Spain, cosmopolitan and with an enviable weather. Daytime temperature in February is 20 C, sunny and lovely!. So plenty of time to sail, sunbathe and relax. Maybe the water will be a bit too cold for swimming. There is good wind and seas are usually flat, no tide to worry about, so sailing is an absolutely pleasure and fun.\n\nTake the late Thursday evening flight after work, or the first in the morning on Friday (only hand luggage needed) and return on Sunday night, jolly, happy, invigorated, well sailed and tan!\n\nThe Alicante marina-harbour is a short cab ride from the Alicante airport, about 20 minutes and max 15 euros per cab. There is also a bus service every 20 minutes for ~2.5 euro.\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/4/5/f/event_32069791.jpeg\n\nAlicante harbour/marina has fantastic facilities and restaurants, bars etc. all around....and the beach! so if we have to wait for the Friday morning people we just hang around and go to Playa del Postiguet (Postiguet beach) which is just 5 minutes walk from the boat.....or just visit the town or do some shopping!\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/0/8/d/event_32261101.jpeg\n\nItinerary (subject to improvement, suggestions and wind direction):\n\nWe will arrive around midnight on Thursday 1rst, so the idea is going straight to the boat and sleep, or go out for a drink and something to eat at the near by pubs in la Rambla.\n\nWe will set off on Friday after breakfast (so we can wait for morning arrivals) for a day sailing around Alicante bay and make a stop over for lunch at the island of Tabarca. We will come back to Alicante harbour on Friday night and go out to enjoy the lively night time atmosphere and some nice Spanish food.\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/6/3/event_50587011.jpeg\n\nTabarca island\n\nOn Saturday Lunch time, we sail off towards the picturesque La Vila Joiosa which literally translates like The Jolly Village. The journey is around 3-4 hours depending on how much tacking we have to do...is up to us mock around and spend more time at sea...or at the beach..(democratic vote) we can also go to Altea which is 6hours away depending on wind direction.\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/b/9/event_32051961.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/3/7/f/event_32085951.jpeg\n\nWe will have time to visit the town and relax, we will spend the night here at the marina, so we can go out to the promenade and enjoy some local food.....Paella and local fish ;-) overlooking the Mare Nostrum (Roman name for the Med)\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/e/f/event_30978671.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/f/5/event_32052021.jpeg\n\nNext, on Sunday morning we sail off towards Alicante aiming to arrive by 4pm so everyone can get the plane back to UK.\n\nWe will have a kitty for food, drinks, fuel and 1 night of marina fees, This kitty will be around £25 each, and includes all breakfast, lunch and snacks, and loads of wine and beer. We will eat out 2 nights and normally works out €17-€20 each including drinks.\n\nBedding is included but you can bring your own sleeping bag. Also a towel and hand luggage. I have toothpaste, shower gel and sunscreen from previous trips so we don't have to bring hold luggage just for the liquids.\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/8/b/f/event_32070911.jpeg\n\nIm happy to answer any questions please email me at [masked]\n\nThe payment of the £195 secures your place.\n\nLets go sailing in the sun!\n\nif you are interested just rsvp yes, pay the trip and wait until I say to book flights, we want to have enough people aboard before doing so. This is the normal procedure and always works fine. In case that we cancel because there is not enough people I will refund all the money.\n\nmasi",

As well as it's natural beauty, Box Hill also plays host to a more recent fort built in the 1890s to help defend England from a possible French invasion and a semi derelict folly from 1815.\n\nWe shall be passing by the route for the 2012 Olympics cycling race this summer - at the steepest point, considered to be the best for viewing due toe the speed of the riders and also the steep banks to watch from with 15,000 spectators expected here!\n\nPlease note: This walk does have some strong climbs and requires a good level of fitness and as it can be slippery strong and appropriate footwear too.\n\nTransport:\n\nWe'll meet at 9:45 am where you can grab a coffee and we'll leave the meeting spot at 10:00 prompt for the 10:08 train. Please note: The tickets are only valid on this train, so you need to be on time please. Anticipated return to London of approx 6pm\n\nWe'll meet in front of WHSmith (no 34) and between this and the stall labelled on the map \"A Piece of Cake\" no 29 (note, it's now actually become \"Bread Box\" at the station):\nhttp://www.networkrail.co.uk/documents/For%20Passengers/Station%20Maps/4510_Victoria%20Station%20Map.pdf\n\nFood\n\nWe'll stop during the walk for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink. We’ll visit a pub near Box Hill after the walk where we can get refreshments\n\nDistance\n\nThe walk is 9 miles and has some hills in it. Hike level: 6/10 Please ensure you're happy keeping up a reasonable pace over this distance\n\nCost:\n\nThe walk will be £16.00 per person which includes the guided hike and return train ticket from London Victoria.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate WARM walking clothes and footwear\n\nWe are likely to encounter mud in places on this walk and there are some steep climbs that can be slippery. Sensible footwear - ideally hiking boots!\n\nWater (at least 1 litre)\n\nPacked lunch/picnic\n\nMoney for pub and food later on\n\nCamera advisable as there are some great photo opportunities\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/4/d/e/event_90925822.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/4/c/event_90925932.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/5/e/2/event_90926082.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/c/0/event_91128832.jpeg",

Part of our route will take us along the ancient path of the Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britains oldest road and we shall also pass the Bridgewater monument - created to honour a Duke who built one of Britains first canals. The area is also part of the Chilterns designated AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty).\n\nIvinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\".\n\nFor the attentive and sharp eyed a 483 foot long white lion carved into a distant chalk hill is also visible from the stunning panorama of Ivinghoe Beacon.\n\nTransport:\n\nWe'll meet at 10:05 am and leave the meeting point at 10:15 prompt for the 10:24 train.

Buckinghamshire is a county well known for it's rivers, canals and landscape and of course the Chiltern Hills further north.\n\nOur walk will cover a very scenic stretch of the Thames taking us past the charming riverside villages of Aston and Hurley and also Marlow lock, which was built in 1773 (although a lock has existed at the site since the 14th century). Time seems to have stood still in this area and even the village of Hurley is little changed since the days when it was a Benedictine Monastry. We'll also get a glimpse of Bisham Abbey and Bisham Church across the Thames. I'm going to stop here before describing the equally picturesque woodland and fields walk we follow back to Marlow.\n\nThe beauty and tranquility of the area has attracted numerous famous residents including Mary Shelley (author of Frankenstein), T.S.Eliot, Heston Blumenthal, Andrew Strauss and even Robbie Williams and David Seaman own properties there.\n\nPlease note this walk is 12 miles long so only for those confident in their ability to cover such a long walk at a reasonable pace.\n\nDue to the longer than usual walk and just over an hours train journey, we estimate to be back into London just after 7pm.\n\nTransport:\n\nWe'll meet at 9:25 and leave this meeting point at 9:35 prompt for the 9:43 train.

Famous past and current residents include Lewis Carroll - author of Alice in Wonderland, Jodie Kidd, Alan Turin, Terry Jones (the Monty Python writer) and Yvonne Arnaud\n\nOnce in Guildford we’ll walk along the picturesque River Wey canal, past the boat houses (and my old rowing club) and onto the optional detour to see the ruin of St Catherine's church. We'll then progress onto the Bluebell Woods (which should now be in bloom) where we’ll join the ancient North Downs Way path along a ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we’ll come to the remote and isolated St Martha’s church (where a church has stood since Saxon times). From here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see eight counties from this point. We’ll then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory since 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now an enchanting derelict site covering 27 acres with much to see.\n\nTransport:\n\nWe'll meet at 10:10 am at Waterloo Station under the main clock (in front of the departures board). We'll leave the meeting point at 10:20 for the 10:30am train so please ensure you're with us by 10:20. As we're purchasing tickets in advance, refunds are not available once you've paid, although you're free to post on the message board if you wish to try to sell your space on.\n\nWe should arrive back into London at approximately 6pm or just after\n\nThe clock is easy to find - a photo is below:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/preamble/291777194/\n\nFood\n\nWe'll stop during the walk for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink. We’ll visit a pub in Guildford after the walk where we can get refreshments\n\nDistance: 9 miles. Please ensure you're happy keeping up a reasonable pace over this distance\n\nHike level: Medium with some hills\n\nCost:\n\nThe walk will be £19.50 per person which includes the guided hike and return train ticket from London Waterloo.\n\nWhat to bring:\n\nAppropriate walking clothes and footwear (hiking boots or similar)\n\nWater (at least 1 litre)\n\nPacked lunch/picnic\n\nMoney for pub and food later on\n\nWaterproofs (if wet or rain looking likely)\n\nCamera advisable as there are some great photo opportunities\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/0/6/event_94174822.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/0/1/c/event_94176892.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/8/9/2/event_94174962.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/1/e/event_94175102.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/9/7/8/event_94175192.jpeg\n\nhttp://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/a/2/2/event_94175362.jpeg",

After passing the village of Hambledon which dates back over 1000 years our trail then heads off through Great Wood and back to Henley along the Oxfordshire Way for a well earned drink in a pretty riverside pub.\n\nThe town of Henley and it’s beauty have attracted many famous names including Liam Gallagher, George Orwell, George Harrison who have/had homes there.\n\nhttp://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/4/5/6/event_112190262.jpeg\n\nTransport:\n\nWe'll meet at 10:10 and leave this meeting point at 10:20 prompt for the 10:27 train.

        "description": "Come and join us for a picturesque adventure with a lot to see which on our previous trips has included deer. Less of a hike into untouched nature than our usual treks, this takes us past Windsor Castle and through the sizeable Windsor Deer Park and on towards the well maintained landscaped grounds that play host to several lakes and ponds. Hopefully the adage that April showers bring May flowers holds true. A scenic walk passing Cumberland Lodge, the Obelisk, crossing over Virginia Water and taking us back into Windsor along the suitably named \"Long Walk\" towards the Castle.\n\nWindsor castle occupies a large site covering 13 acres and has a long history stretching back nearly 1000 years to the Norman invasion. During the intervening period it survived the English Civil War unscathed and has since been enlarged and rebuilt in what was to become the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England. A history spanning Monarchs from Henry VIII to Queen Victoria and then as a refuge for the Royal Family during World War II and it was even used to imprison King Charles I before he was executed.\n\nThis brings us on neatly to Windsor Deer park which is 20km2 and for centuries was the private hunting ground for Windsor Castle. As such, it has been heavily landscaped and is well maintained with a wide variety of plants, flowers and trees. Our trail takes us through the park and past the substantial Virginia Water Lake as well as through Valley Gardens - a 220 acre botanical garden planted under the watchful eye of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen mother. They contain unrivalled collections of azaleas, camellias, magnolias and the largest planting of rhododendrons in the world.\n\nTransport:\n\nWe'll meet at 10:00 and leave this meeting point at 10:10 prompt for the 10:21 train.

We then follow the Ridgeway trail on to Coombe Hill - the highest viewpoint in the Chilterns for some spectacular views over the Vale of Aylesbury and stretching up towards the Midlands. Our route then takes us through woods and rolling fields. We'll actually be walking across the driveway of the Chequers estate (the country retreat of the prime minister) before heading through the rich and varied agricultural land of the Aylesbury Ring back to Wendover. The current house at Chequers dates from 1565 and has a colourful history including links to the families of Henry VII and Oliver Cromwell.

        "description": "We have put together this fantastic 3 day trip - we're off to the Brecon Beacons National park for Hiking and Partying!\n\nThis is one of three trips we organise to very different areas of this fabulous mountain range. This one to the central Brecons provides both the best hiking and takes in what are probably the three most popular and truly spectacular walks in this National Park.\n\nOur trip leader Graham knows his area very well having spent 4 years living close by and he's done the main hike on this trip over 27 times!\n\nWe’ll spend a day walking over the mountains that surround the Neuadd reservoir and then on Sunday we’ll take in a less tough waterfall walk. Sunday is saved for the beautiful Tor Y Foel. We'll also have a party one evening after our group meal in the gorgeous setting or our remote converted barn - the only 5 star rated hostel in the UK!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n* 3 gorgeous and contrasting hikes high in the Brecon Beacons National Park\n* Stay in a lovely converted stone barn eco hostel - awarded the Greenest hostel in the UK status in 2013\n* A fully catered trip\n* A closer trip than usual - only about 3 hours driving from London\n* Hike the iconic Brecons Horseshoe\n* Enjoy gorgeous scenery passing 4 stunning waterfalls\n\nPhotos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips\n\nClick [LINK](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics) to join our Facebook community\n\n**Weekend Description**\n\nThe Horseshoe walk is the most popular in the Brecon Beacons and it's easy to see why with staggering views as it takes in 3 mountain peaks. Having hiked the entire National Park extensively, it's the guide's personal favourite. It's fairly tough but offers breath taking views over the flat land to the North and back into the Brecon Beacons mountain range and on a clear day you can even see the sea and Gower Peninsula.\n\nThe waterfalls walk is a less tough walk and passes 4 substantial waterfalls, one of which we actually walk behind. With a huge torrent of water rushing past and the noise and spray, it's a pretty exhilarating experience by itself. There is some gorgeous scenery and superb photo opportunities as we follow the winding trail of the river and we'll also visit the largest cave opening in South Wales where we can walk inside.\n\nWe are staying in one of the only 5 star hostels in the UK - a gorgeous converted stone barn remote in the Brecon Beacons. With an ultra low carbon footprint, this eco hostel has been awarded the Greenest hostel in the UK status in 2013. To fully enjoy our rural mountainous setting and so that everyone can get to know each other, we will be enjoying a group meal in the evening.\n\nOn the last day we take in the smaller peak of Tor Y Foel which offers fine views of the surrounding area, being a very isolated peak. We’ll then follow the Brecon and Monmouthshire canal (which has been restored and is now navigable) into the village of Talybont and enjoy the option of a pub drink before driving back.\n\n**ITINERARY**\n\nThursday 28th July\n\nHead over to the hostel which we have hired exclusively for our group.\n\nFriday 29th July\n\nFriday's hike: The Brecon Horseshoe\nDistance: 9 miles (14km)\nAscent: Approx 600m\nGrading: Challenging, one steep climb at the start, a good level of fitness required (we are taking in 3 mountain peaks in about 5 to 6 hours of walking) - click [LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings) for details\n\nThe walk takes in the highest mountain in South Wales - Pen Y Fan (886m) as well as the mountain peaks of Corn Du and Cribyn. It’s a dramatic, raw and rugged landscape dotted with occasional reservoirs and set above valleys and rivers, made even more exhilarating by the ridge top walks and far stretching views.\n\nAfter the hike we return to our barn hostel for a 3 course dinner followed by a party\n\nSaturday 30th July\n\nSaturday's hike: The waterfalls of the Afon Mellte river\nDistance: 6 miles (9km)\nAscent: 270m\nGrading: Intermediate/Challenging, with rough stony ground in places and steep sections, it can be slippery - click [LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings) for details\n\nWe’ll follow the Afon Mellte river through a deep and rich woodland valley passing four waterfalls on the way. The area has very lush vegetation and has been designated a site of special scientific interest. We'll get to actually walk behind a waterfall too as well as venture into the mouth of the largest cave opening in South Wales.\n\nAfter the hike we return to our barn for a barbecue that we'll all get involved in cooking\n\nSunday 31st July\n\nSunday's hike: Tor Y Foel and the Monmouthsire and Brecon canal\nDistance: 7.5 to 9 miles (12km to 15km)\nGrading: Beginner/Intermediate, one main hill to climb - click [LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings) for details\n\nWe'll hike to the peak of Tor Y Foel which offers superb views of the surrounding area before following a gorgeous and picture postcard trail along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal (dating from 1796) that takes us to the village of Talybont.\n\n**Cost and Payment**\n\nThe trip is £248 per person.

        "description": "Our toughest day hike from London - are you up for the challenge?\n\nTaking in the three highest peaks in Surrey - Box hill (224m), Leith Hill (294m) and Holmbury Hill (261m) and being nearly as long as the Yorkshire Three Peaks, they are also known as the Yorkshire cousins. This is a formidable challenge and very accessible from London in a day.\n\nAs well as being a stunning route in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty it's also a great training hike for anyone doing a big challenge this year like The Yorkshire or National 3 Peaks as well as Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Conquer the 3 Surrey peaks - situation in an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”\n\n• Enjoy breathtaking hiking through the woods and hills of the North Downs\n\n• Hike through England's largest vineyard - Denbies Wine Estate\n\n• See the twisting Box hill roads of the 2012 Olympics cycle race where the cyclists did 9 laps of this spectacular section\n\n• Great training hike for any tough challenges you have coming up\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nAs well as being a great challenge, this hike is also stunningly beautiful, taking in much of the Surrey Hills, Surrey is the most heavily wooded county in England and also conveniently very close to London.\n\nHiking for 21 miles and taking in some amazing scenery across the three Surrey peaks, our trail will pass through ancient sandy trails and woodlands and offers spectacular views from all three of the hills. Upon reaching Leith Hill we get some of the most far reaching views of any hike we do - being the second highest point in South East England. We will see as far as the South Downs by the sea and on a clear day from the Northern edge of the hill we can see several central London landmark buildings\n\nThis is a tough hike, but if needed it’s easy to skip the last hill and hence shorten the hike a little if you want (self guided). Due to the length of the hike we do not have our usual end of hike pub stop\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8am leaving the meeting point at 8:15am for the 8:25am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.\n\nWe meet between WHSmith (no 34) and Nero Express (no 29) - [MAP LINK](https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx)\n\nPlanned arrival time back into London is 8:32pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for the day until then)\n\n**Food**\n\nWe'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

        "description": "Join us in this picturesque exploration of the North Downs and the gorgeous Kent countryside, also known as the \"Garden of England\". This hike takes us on a hilly trail through magnificent rolling uplands, dry valleys and shady woodlands using the ancient routes of the Weald Way, the Pilgrims Way and the North Downs Way.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike through picturesque parts of the Pilgrims, North Downs and Weald Ways to discover a stunning part of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\n• See the remains of the ancient village of Dode wiped out by the plague long ago but with its 1000 year old church still remaining\n\n• See the long barrow of Coldrum Stones - 1000 years older than Stonehenge\n\n• Hike through the spectacular Cobham Woods and the ancient Deer Park home to the Darnley Mausoleum\n\n• Visit Cobham with its links to Charles Dickens and its historic buildings such as Cobham College - the quadrangular building retaining the remains of the original foundations of the college built by Sir John de Cobham in 1362\n\n• Pass by Luddesdown Court - with its Grade I listed church and manor building with oak beam hall and stone dressing\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nOur journey begins at Sole Street from where we go through vast rolling fields passing Luddesdown Court. Following the Weald Way, we pass through the lost village of Dode dating from Roman times but wiped out by the great plague leaving just its 1000 year old Norman Church building and legend has it ghosts too.\n\nPassing tranquil shady woods along the Weald Way, we hike to the long barrow of Coldrum Stones constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period and whose name means \"place of enchantments\". It is one of the earliest prehistoric monuments in Britain - more than 1000 older than Stonehenge and offers stunning views from its top.\n\nNext we head along the ancient Pilgrims Way to the top of the North Downs escarpment again to have lunch. Crossing through more than eight different woods, we reach Upper Bush - a beautiful hamlet. Much of this section of the hike goes through very peaceful countryside with a remote feeling making you believe you are far away from anywhere!\n\nFollowing another ascent, we reach the gorgeous Cobham Woods which is an old deer park containing the impressive Darnley Mausoleum. From here we eventually reach the beautiful and historic village of Cobham which has a 13th century church with reportedly some of the finest and oldest brass memorials in England. Here we will stop to rest a while at one of the village's three pubs - a medieval timber framed pub that was a favorite of Charles Dickens. After our well deserved drink we head off through orchards back to Sole Street for the return train home.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:42am train.

        "description": "Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England\n\n• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed\n\n• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike\n\n• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town\n\n• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK\n\nPhotos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThis hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.\n\nOur hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

So long as the weather is suitable we will cross the iconic Striding Edge on the way up before ticking off Helvellyn, Nethermost Pike, Dollywaggon Pike, St Sunday Crag, Birks and Arnison Crag before arriving back in Patterdale.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Approx 12 to 14 attendees\n\n• Climb the third highest mountain in England, Helvellyn (949m)\n\n• Discover England's largest National park which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site - The Lake District\n\n• Take in five other summits (all Wainwrights): Nethermost Pike (891m), Dollywaggon Pike (858m), St Sunday Crag (841m), Birks (622m) and Arnison Crag (433m)\n\n• Tackle the stunning Striding Edge\n\n• See the secluded Grisedale Tarn and the Brothers Parting Stone where the poet, William Wordsworth said goodbye to his brother, John for the last time\n\n• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nStarting in the pretty village of Patterdale outside the parish church of St Patrick from which the village takes its name, we hike up to the summit of Helvellyn. So long as the weather is suitable, we will cross the iconic, knife edge arete of Striding Edge which has a large amount of exposure and is seriously only for those with a head for heights. If the weather is less than perfect then a different route will be chosen.\n\nOnce we have reached the summit of Helvellyn, with its wide ranging views across the rest of the Lake District and the distant North Pennines (even Scotland on a clear day) then we will keep to high ground to the summits of Nethermost Pike and Dollywaggon Pike which are also in the list of England’s top ten highest mountains. Once we leave Dollywaggon Pike we will head down for a little while to arrive at Grisedale Pike and The Brother’s Parting Stone where William Wordsworth said goodbye to his sea captain brother, John for the last time before he was sadly drowned in a shipwreck but, which is an idyllic place to stop and have lunch and look down the valley of Grisedale to Ullswater lake and the large, imposing shape of St Sunday Crag which we will be climbing once we have finished eating.\n\nOnce lunch is over we will start to climb again up a small path that takes us to the summit of our next mountain, St Sunday Crag (841m) which, in Trail magazine, is listed as one of the top 100 mountains in the UK (along with Helvellyn from this hike). The view from the top is dramatic, looking to Fairfield one way, almost lengthways down Ullswater and side on to the profile of Striding Edge. From there we take a steep but increasingly easy path to climb two subsidiary summits of Birks and Arnison Crags before arriving back into Patterdale\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at 8:45am at at the car parking at the side of the road near to Patterdale and CA11 0NL\n\nMap of meeting point: [LINK](https://bit.ly/39CYpOc)\n\nWe recommend you to arrive the night before and stay nearby. Because the hike often takes up to 10 hours or more, so it may be more suitable to stay another night and return the following day if you're travelling by train.\n\nYou will need transport to and from the start of this hike, which is outside London. Outdooraholics cannot get involved with private lift share arrangements, however we have set up a lift share discussion where you can offer/request lifts - [LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53545110/). Please contact people via this forum and post there if you can offer or need a lift or plan to hire a car and can offer spaces.\n\nIf coming by train, to avoid taking the early morning train we suggest arriving the day before and spending at least a night there making a weekend away out of it.

A delightful rural hike which amongst other things takes us past two castles – Eynsford Castle and Lullingstone Castle and along a stretch of the River Darent.\n\nWe hike the Darent Valley Path alongside the River Darent and through the picturesque Kent fields and ancient wood. The area’s beauty attracted the Romans to settle here and in 80 AD Lullingstone Villa was constructed for a wealthy Roman who was keen on pagan worship.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Pass the magnificent Lullingstone Castle\n\n• Hike along a delightful stretch of the Darent Valley Path\n\n• Pass the site of the ruins of Lullingstone Roman Villa with its pagan history\n\n• Hike through the picturesque Lullingstone Country Park\n\n• Visit the remains Eynsford Castle\n\n• Explore 3 charming Kentish villages\n\n• Hike through the 22 metre high Eynsford Rail Viaduct with its nine red brick arches\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start from the picturesque village of Otford, occupied for at least 3000 years.

The park is internationally important due to its collection of ancient trees including beech, ash, oak, sweet chestnut and hornbeam some of which are believed to be 800 years old.\n\nWe reach Lullingstone Castle to admire its tranquil lake before we pass the historical Lullingstone Roman Villa - one of the few Roman estate survivals in Britain whose construction began in about 100 AD.\n\nFrom there, our hike continues among the rolling fields of Kent which reward with views towards the 9 arched Eynsford Rail Viaduct. Reaching the tranquil village of Eynsford, we explore the remains of Eynsford Castle - a medieval fortification built in 1088 and we finish our hike with a stroll along the lovely village.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:15am for the 9:25am train.

One of the toughest and most adventurous routes in England covering a distance of 40km and summiting 3 mountains in one day!\n\nThe hike offers spectacular far reaching views and challenging rugged terrain and is set within the breathtaking Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route climbs a total of about 1500m of ascent with a few steep sections.\n\nThis is the toughest and most challenging hike Outdooraholics do in the UK and is not for beginners!\n\nFor further details on this trip please see our Yorkshire 3 Peaks PDF- [LINK](https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire3Peaks.pdf)\n\nTo check in to the Yorkshire Three Peaks Facebook page: [LINK](https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireThreePeaksChallenge)\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Undertake this famous and formidable 40km hilly challenge\n\n• Small group of just 14 hikers\n\n• Build your own weekend trip around this day hike\n\n• Challenging hiking experience in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park\n\n• Climb Whernside - the highest peak in the Yorkshire Dales at 736m\n\n• Enjoy spectacular views across the Yorkshire Dales National Park - on a clear day we can also see the Lake District and the sea\n\n• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups\n\n• The perfect challenge to set yourself for 2020 or great training for anyone doing big hikes like Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThe three peaks to be climbed are Pen-y-ghent (694m), Whernside (736m) and Ingleborough (723m) with each peak offering a different degree of difficulty. We will do the most popular hike starting in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale and the hike is around 25 miles (40km) long with a total of about 1500m of ascent.\n\nThe ascent of Ingleborough passes large areas of limestone rock before the path gets steeper and rockier as we reach the flat summit with its ancient fortifications and views across Morecambe Bay and on a clear day the Lake District. A steep descent eventually leads to the hamlet of Chapel le Dale and the gradual climb to the top of the second peak, Whernside (736m), the highest point in North Yorkshire. The route back down takes us alongside one of the wonders of the industrial revolution, Ribblehead viaduct (built in 1874, 400m wide and using 1.5 million bricks)! There now follows a long hike through fantastic limestone scenery before a steep climb up to the top of Pen y Ghent and then a quick drop down the front (with some easy scrambling) back to Horton. A very fine challenge and also a superb hike.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Horton car park at 7:45am (20m south of BD24 0HF on B6479) and leave at 8am prompt - please buy a parking ticket to cover all day.

You could arrive the night before and stay in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale. Because the hike often takes 10 to 12 hours or more, it may be more suitable to stay another night and return the following day if you're travelling by train.\n\n**Food**\n\nWe'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

        "description": "Join us to explore the hidden treasures of Eden Valley, stepping back in ancient times while soaking in the rich green hues of this picturesque landscape! We embark upon a journey through time past ancient woodlands, tranquil rivers and remarkable historical buildings. These divine landscapes with their rolling hills, grassy fields and deciduous woods are keepers of many medieval houses and castles that can be traced back to the 11th century. Starting from Tonbridge, where many of Jane Austen's family houses are located, we hike through the countryside to pass the hunting lodge of King Henry VIII and reach Chiddingstone - a Tudor one street village. We pass by Leigh and end the hike back in Tonbridge with a view of the motte and bailey Tonbridge castle.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Discover the picturesque Eden Valley\n\n• Pass the Medieval Manor House Penshurst Place - a hunting lodge of King Henry VIII\n\n• Visit one of Kent’s most attractive villages - Chiddingstone - famed for its architecture, ghost stories and use as a filming location\n\n• Hike along the banks of the rivers Eden and Medway in the High Weald area - considered one of the best surviving medieval landscapes in Northern Europe\n\n• Visit the buzzing Tonbridge - a market town from the Middle Ages\n\n• Pass the 11th century Tonbridge Castle - a great example of motte and bailey gatehouse beside the River Medway\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start off in Tonbridge village, with its idyllic manors and picture postcard castle. As we reach Haysden Country Park, our hike opens up to the breathtaking greens across parkland, woodlands, open fields and low hills. The High Weald is considered to be one of the best surviving medieval landscapes in Northern Europe. The area boasts the highest proportion of ancient woodland in the country and is one of the most densely wooded landscapes in Britain. Following a sunken lane, we start treading in the steps of Saxon drovers. We take a short break to admire Penshurst Place - an impressive sight that has kept rich history throughout the decades. The original medieval house is one of the most complete surviving examples of 14th century domestic architecture in England. In the mid 16th century it was the hunting ground of Henry VIII.\n\nOur path crosses the rivers Eden and Medway meandering across the enchanting Eden Valley. In the afternoon the charming Chiddingstone will accommodates us for lunch. It is a potent example of a single street Tudor village in typical Kent style. The village shop and post office date back to 1453 – just before the Wars of the Roses. After lunch we pass by Leigh and we see the remains of Tonbridge Castle, built in the 11th century and reputedly England's finest example of a motte and bailey castle.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Charing Cross station at 8:10am leaving the meeting point at 8:25am for the 8:40am train.

The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.\n\nOur hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

This diverse and stunning hike takes us on a journey via Knole House, Knole Deer Park and Ightham Mote. We usually see deer too in one of the last Tudor Deer Parks in the UK.\n\nCome and see for yourself why the beauty of this area attracted the Beatles to film promotional videos for \"Penny Lane\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" here.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike along a stunning stretch of the Greensands Way - much of which is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\n• Explore the ancient 1000 acre Knole Deer Park\n\n• See the stunning Knole House - one of England's largest houses boasting 365 rooms, 52 staircases, 12 entrances and 7 courtyards\n\n• Pass through Ightham Mote - Grade I listed medieval moated manor house dating from circa 1340AD\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nOur hike takes us through the 1000 acre Knole Deer Park which is home to over 350 deer and whose picturesque landscape attracted the Beatles to film promotional videos for \"Penny Lane\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". The videos went on to be selected by New York's MoMA as two of the most influential music videos of the late 1960s.\n\nKnole House is one of England's largest houses boasting 365 rooms and 52 staircases and has remained surprisingly unchanged during its history going back to 1486. Being surrounded by the glorious 1000 acre Knole Deer Park completes its picturesque setting.\n\nWe also pass Ightham Mote, a largely original moated medieval manor house dating back to 1320 and described by David Starkey as \"one of the most beautiful and interesting of English country houses\".

        "description": "We’re off to the North Downs in Surrey - an area so spectacular it’s been designated an official Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This hike starts at the charming historic town of Guildford which has a long and varied history dating back thousands of years to the Bronze Age and more recently to the castle that the Normans built 1000 years ago.\n\nOur hike reveals lush countryside, bright and open woodlands and follows the River Wey Canal - we go beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings for which Guildford is famed. We visit an enchanting ancient church nestling on St Martha’s Hill with breathtaking panoramic views almost as far as the sea. We then finish in Guildford to get a glimpse of this picture postcard town that’s just a 35 minute train journey from London.\n\nThis hike was designed and written by one of our hike leaders who was born and lived in Guildford and we show you its undiscovered gems!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Explore the beautiful Surrey countryside Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\n• Admire the far reaching views of St Martha's hill with its historic church\n\n• Visit Guildford - Surrey's most significant ancient town with Bronze Age roots and see for yourself why it has attracted many famous residents.\n\n• Follow the tranquil River Wey as it gently flows past willow trees through rural Surrey\n\n• Visit the enchanting ruins of the 14th century St Catherine's Chapel - which attracted the artist Turner to paint it in 1807 and 1808\n\n• Hike along part of the North Downs Way - the 2nd most acclaimed long distance route in South East England\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nGuildford is best known for being a picturesque and quaint market town near London, but the countryside has far more to offer than most visitors discover beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings. Famous past and current residents include Lewis Carroll - author of Alice in Wonderland, Jodie Kidd, Alan Turin, Terry Jones (the Monty Python writer) and Yvonne Arnaud. William Turner came to paint St Catherine's Church in 1707 and 1708 and his paintings now hang in the Tate Gallery.\n\nOnce in Guildford we hike along the picturesque River Wey canal where the nestled boat houses sit on this tranquil waterway leading us to the ruin of St Catherine's church. We then hike into Bluebell Woods where we join the ancient North Downs Way path along a ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we come to the remote and isolated St Martha’s church built in the 12th century.\n\nFrom here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see seven counties from this point. We then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory built by the East India Company in 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now an enchanting derelict site covering 27 acres with much to see including relics, tramways and buildings from its nearly 400 year history.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Waterloo station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9am train.

We're off to historic Arundel in Sussex and breaking with tradition we'll also have a brief stop mid hike at a delightful little pub on the banks of the river Arun for that irresistible sneaky river side pint to satisfy the Outdoor Alcoholics.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike the chalk hills with breathtaking views to the distant sea\n\n• Explore the landscaped Arundel Park with its woodland, Swanbourne lake, meadows and the Gothic Hiorne Tower\n\n• Superb views of the 12th century Arundel Castle\n\n• Follow the river Arun on a picturesque trail towards Arundel Castle\n\n• Visit the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral (French Gothic style)\n\n• Riverside pub visit\n\n• Visit the well preserved Sussex ancient market town of Arundel\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nA delightful mix of scenery with a good stretch along the river Arun, a visit to the woods and hills of Arundel Park and the striking and extravagant castellated Hiorne tower. We'll then venture into Arundel with its Gothic and enchanting castle dominating and looming over the town to finish our hike by finding the mighty Arundel Cathedral. We'll get some far off and ever nearing views of the castle as we follow the meandering and lazy river Arun. As well as the quick mid hike pub stop we'll have our usual refreshments in Arundel before making our way back to London. We'll pop up to hike past Arundel Cathedral but sadly can't get into the grounds or very close to Arundel Castle as admission is charged.\n\nWith just under 2500 inhabitants Arundel is a small town, but has been home to the very rich and powerful Dukes of Norfolk for over 400 years. The original Mott and Bailey castle was built on the site in 1067 by the Normans after their invasion of Britain in 1066 and has since been rebuilt and expanded to provide the grand modern day stately home. The castle is still inhabited by the Dukes of Norfolk with the 18th Duke residing there currently. Hiorne Tower was built in Arundel Park in 1787 as an extravagant folly for the Duke of Norfolk and has a commanding position high on the hills and is quite enchanting and captivating.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:15am for the 9:20am train.

        "description": "A picturesque hiking trail through the Chilterns Hills - an officially designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\n\nThis is a great hike towards the prominent beauty spot of Ivinghoe Beacon with some superb far reaching views. It is also a beginners hike and we return to London earlier than usual, so it is ideal for people new to hiking or those who have plans for the evening. We finish in a picture postcard country pub for some well deserved refreshments.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike to the start of the famous Ridgeway Trail - Britain's oldest trail dating back at least 5000 years\n\n• Get views of the huge 147m white lion carved into the hillside at Whipsnade\n\n• Walk some fantastic hills in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\n• Visit the Bridgewater Monument - a 33m tall tower built in 1832 in memory of the third Duke of Bridgewater\n\n• Visit the tiny village of Aldbury - a picturesque setting often referred to as a ''chocolate-box'' village due to its traditional appearance\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThis hike takes in both some stunning scenery and a good bit of history. We hike through beech woodland, chalk uplands and get some great views over the vale of Aldbury before leading back through the woods of the Ashridge Estate - the former home of the Dukes of Bridgewater. We then drop into the quaint and unspoilt village of Aldbury. Part of our route takes us along the ancient path of the famous Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britain's oldest road and we also pass the Bridgewater Monument - created to honour the Duke who built one of Britain's first canals.\n\nIvinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\".\n\nFor the attentive and sharp eyed a 483 foot long white lion carved into a distant chalk hill is also visible from the stunning panorama of Ivinghoe Beacon.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Euston station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9:03am train.

On the way there, we will hike along the elevated South Downs hills, summiting Ditchling Beacon to enjoy splendid sea views and diverse countryside, as the sea gets larger and larger and eventually we'll end up on the beach at Brighton.\n\nWe will also have some time to explore Brighton itself - wander along the famous Lanes with the sound of the buskers livening up the streets, and lose ourselves in the bars, cafe's and independent jewellery and antique shops. You can even get a zip wire experience on the seafront. We will have some time to enjoy the pebble beach, and if you're feeling really in the seaside mood, grab some good old British Fish and Chips.

Instead, this route starts off at Hassocks and then traverses north to south exploring hidden valleys, woods, open green expanses and parkland.\n\nThe end point is the lively town of Brighton, famous for its vibrant nightlife, and we will be rewarded with a trip to the sea at Brighton Waterfront. Before that we will pass through the cosy village of Ditchling, then stand atop Ditchling Beacon, explore the green expanse of the Stanmer Park, pass Stanmer House, then walk through the University of Sussex campus to Falmer. We will enjoy a lovely view of the sea from Kemp Town Racecourse and then walk into the splendour that is Brighton. The boardwalk, pier, seafront bars, Mediterranean cuisine and fish and chips of England's most famous beach await you!\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:45am leaving the meeting point at 9am for the 9:15am train.

A glorious circular hike from the ancient market town of Farnham steeped in history going back nearly 1000 years on this trail through time. One of the very first Outdooraholics hikes from all those years ago, but still a timeless classic.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Explore the romantic and enchanting ruins of an abandoned abbey dating back nearly 1000 years\n\n• Visit the famous and picture postcard Tilford village cricket green\n\n• See an 800 year old oak tree\n\n• Visit a cave where supposedly a White Witch lived (Mother Ludlam)\n\n• Explore the Bourne Woods and see where Gladiator and over 20 other films were set\n\n• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey through woodland paths\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nStarting in the historic and attractive Georgian market town of Farnham, we go on a woodland valley trail via Mother Ludlam's cave (home to the White Witch of Waverley according to the legend), past Moor Park House, and then on to explore the site of Waverley Abbey ruins (founded 1128) and to see the grand Waverley Abbey House set on a lake. Our trail passes the famous cricket green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the River Wey and flanked by two medieval stone bridges and then onto the Bourne Woods.\n\nTilford Green is a superb example of a traditional village green from a long gone era - with a cricket pitch, pub and two medieval stone bridges. We then head on to visit an 800 year old oak tree (8 metre girth) before making our way back to Farnham. We also pass a farm where we see pigs (and often baby piglets). The Bourne woods has an interesting mix of heathland and coniferous trees and its beauty has drawn filmmakers for films such as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Princess, War Horse and at least 20 others - we'll be hiking through the area where these were filmed.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Waterloo station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9:05am train.

This is a formidable challenge and very accessible from London in a day.\n\nAs well as being a stunning route in the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty it's also a great training hike for anyone doing a big challenge this year like The Yorkshire or National 3 Peaks as well as Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Conquer the 3 Surrey peaks - situation in an “Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty”\n\n• Enjoy breathtaking hiking through the woods and hills of the North Downs\n\n• Hike through England's largest vineyard - Denbies Wine Estate\n\n• See the twisting Box hill roads of the 2012 Olympics cycle race where the cyclists did 9 laps of this spectacular section\n\n• Great training hike for any tough challenges you have coming up\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nAs well as being a great challenge, this hike is also stunningly beautiful, taking in much of the Surrey Hills, Surrey is the most heavily wooded county in England and also conveniently very close to London.\n\nHiking for 21 miles and taking in some amazing scenery across the three Surrey peaks, our trail will pass through ancient sandy trails and woodlands and offers spectacular views from all three of the hills. Upon reaching Leith Hill we get some of the most far reaching views of any hike we do - being the second highest point in South East England. We will see as far as the South Downs by the sea and on a clear day from the Northern edge of the hill we can see several central London landmark buildings\n\nThis is a tough hike, but if needed it’s easy to skip the last hill and hence shorten the hike a little if you want (self guided). Due to the length of the hike we do not have our usual end of hike pub stop\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8am leaving the meeting point at 8:15am for the 8:25am train.

A glorious circular hike from the ancient market town of Farnham steeped in history going back nearly 1000 years on this trail through time. One of the very first Outdooraholics hikes from all those years ago, but still a timeless classic.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Explore the romantic and enchanting ruins of an abandoned abbey dating back nearly 1000 years\n\n• Visit the famous and picture postcard Tilford village cricket green\n\n• See an 800 year old oak tree\n\n• Visit a cave where supposedly a White Witch lived (Mother Ludlam)\n\n• Explore the Bourne Woods and see where Gladiator and over 20 other films were set\n\n• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey through woodland paths\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nStarting in the historic and attractive Georgian market town of Farnham, we go on a woodland valley trail via Mother Ludlam's cave (home to the White Witch of Waverley according to the legend), past Moor Park House, and then on to explore the site of Waverley Abbey ruins (founded 1128) and to see the grand Waverley Abbey House set on a lake. Our trail passes the famous cricket green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the River Wey and flanked by two medieval stone bridges and then onto the Bourne Woods.\n\nTilford Green is a superb example of a traditional village green from a long gone era - with a cricket pitch, pub and two medieval stone bridges. We then head on to visit an 800 year old oak tree (8 metre girth) before making our way back to Farnham. We also pass a farm where we see pigs (and often baby piglets). The Bourne woods has an interesting mix of heathland and coniferous trees and its beauty has drawn filmmakers for films such as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Princess, War Horse and at least 20 others - we'll be hiking through the area where these were filmed.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Waterloo station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9am train.

We quickly leave the crowds behind as we head for the seldom used but spectacular South Ridge, considered to be the hardest as it is longer and involves a section of scrambling and the final sadistic scree pull to Bwlch Main, but one of the most pleasant walks in Snowdonia.\n\nWe cross the subsidiary summit of Allt Maenderyn (701 metres) before continuing along the Clogwyn Du (Black Cliffs) and Bwlch Main to the summit of Snowdon itself (1085 metres).\n\nAfter admiring the views from every edge of the summit and taking some photos to make this moment live forever, we initially follow the top of The Watkin path before once again leaving it to cross the summit of Y Lliwydd (898 metres) where the famous mountaineer George Mallory practiced for his 1953 Everest attempt. We then drop back down via a series of abandoned mines and waterfalls to the beginning.\n\nWe can come across sheep, goats, cattle and birds of prey who live on Snowdon. Also, colourful alpine flowers flourish on the mountainside - the Snowdon Lily - a rare, delicate flowering plant which has grass-like leaves.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Parking For Watkin Path, postcode: LL55 4NR. The hike will start at 9am with planned end time between 5:30 and 6:30pm depending on the weather and pace.

We'll hike some of the classic and best loved mountains in the Lake District with 3 hike leaders each day so we can split into smaller groups.\n\nYou can also set off on a gentle self-guided walk from the hostel if you prefer for a day or it's easy to catch a boat around the Lake and into Keswick from the hostel garden.\n\nTOUGHNESS.

        "description": "The legendary Outdooraholics \"Fourteen Sisters\" hike is back - we hike the Seven Sisters hills twice\n\nCome and join us for our own tough version of what is our most popular and probably the greatest coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs and a good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the Outdooraholics created \"Fourteen Sisters\" hike: https://www.facebook.com/fourteensisters\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Set yourself a real challenge - hike the legendary Seven Sisters in both directions and admire the absolutely stunning coastal views\n\n• 26km and 750m of ascent AND 750m descent with 16 hills to hike up and down\n\n• Our toughest London based hike - not for beginners or those who like a gentle pace\n\n• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England\n\n• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed\n\n• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town\n\n• Larger group size than usual for more social fun!\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe've worked hard to get people along to our the Seven Sisters hike - we run this at least twice most months and it's a breathtaking hike. We devised and created the \"Fourteen Sisters\" in 2013 with a superb route taking in the best of the Seven Sisters in both directions. It's a tough hike for experienced hikers only.\n\nThere are iconic views on this hike and we get fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last ice age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.\n\nOur hike starts in the coastal town of Eastbourne. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike also takes in the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side being a magnet for those wishing to commit suicide. After finishing the Seven Sisters route, we hike back along it in the other direction offering different and equally breathtaking views as we head back to Eastbourne to our end of pub hike.\n\nToughness - can I really do this?\n\nWe're not going to deceive you, for most people this will be a tough physical challenge. We hike over about 16 hills in total during the day.\n\nThe hike is long and will be done at a fairly brisk pace (not a stroll). It is also usually a larger group size so more social fun.\n\nMost people who are fit and regular hikers should be able to take on this challenge. You will have various options to leave the hike safely if needed but please do only sign up if this tough physical challenge appeals. If you have an injury or are unwell on the day, we strongly advise not taking part in this hike.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:40am for the 8:54am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.\n\nWe meet between WHSmith (no 34) and Nero Express (no 29) - [MAP LINK](https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx)\n\nPlanned arrival time back into London is 7:36pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for the day until then)\n\n**Food**\n\nWe'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

Please keep at least 3 metres away from the edges. If you fall, or the ground at the edge of the cliff collapses it will almost certainly be fatal.",

Both of these giant figures had a lifelong love of the outdoors and we’re going to show you why with this fantastic hike through a gorgeous part of Kent (known as the \"Garden of England\").\n\nWe pass near by Churchill’s family home along with other historical estates such as Emmetts Garden and Tenchleys Manor.

From there we continue on to the Greensand Way, which goes across grassy meadows and leads to Limpsfield Common and the historic Tenchleys Manor built in 1599. We then continue onto Crockham Hill - home to Octavia Hill where she chose to be buried. Much of the land in the area was acquired for the National Trust through Octavia's efforts.\n\nFrom the village we progress onto Chartwell to see the splendid adulthood home and garden of Sir Winston Churchill and after a short rest we move on to see the charming Chartwell farm. Following the picturesque views across the weald on Puddledock Lane, we continue on to Toys Hill (235m) - a hamlet situated on the steep scarp slope of the Greensand Ridge which inspired Octavia Hill to create the National Trust. After admiring the views from Toys Hill, we hike to Emmetts Garden - an Edwardian estate located on Ide Hill and from there we return back to Oxted passing the quaint village of Westerham.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:20am leaving the meeting point at 8:35am for the 8:50am train.

        "description": "This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.\n\nEngland’s most beautiful and second largest lake.\n24 miles (39 KM), 1000 METRES OF ASCENT.\n\nCol is well known to the group - he is both Mountain Rescue and also a Mountain Leader and leads all of our tougher and more challenging mountain hikes.\n\nFor 2021 we have a new trip with him and it’s fantastic! It’s slightly less tough than the “25 miles Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge, but far more stunning and picturesque, being set in the Lake District and by England’s second largest lake and many would argue the most beautiful. This is a tough 20 mile hike and with 1000m of ascent as we head up the mountains surrounding the lake for breath taking panoramic views. Let Col show you why the Lake District is considered the most stunning part of England!\n\nThis is the place where Wordsworth saw his daffodils, where is the oldest native red deer herd in England, the most famous and most visited waterfall in the Lake District - Aira Force. With so many fantastic views, wildlife, history and villages en-route this is a great hike and also a great location with a lot of options to build your own weekend trip around this day hike.\n\nThis trip is tough and only for fit and experienced hikers who want a tough challenge.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Approx 12 to 14 attendees\n\n• Complete the full 20-miles circuit around Ullswater lake surrounded by stunning mountain scenery\n\n• Discover England's largest National park which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site - The Lake District\n\n• Spectacular high up views across Ullswater\n\n• See the glorious waterfalls of the famous Aira Force\n\n• Walk around Gowbarrow Fell and through Glencoyne and see why Wordsworth loved this area so much so he wrote his beautiful poem after a walk there\n\n• Visit the impressive stone circles Cockpit which original purpose still remains a mystery, and some ancient churches along the way\n\n• The small, pretty villages of Pooley Bridge, Glenridding, Patterdale and Howtown\n\n• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThe walk starts in Pooley Bridge, the forest path via Dunmallard Hill and heads out anticlockwise as the hill discovers a spectacular view over the lake and outlines our path ahead.\n\nThen we follow the grounds of Waterfoot Park, nestled in a picturesque location with beautiful views of the surrounding fells, and through the quiet woodland of Swinburn Park (one of five medieval deer parks in the past surrounding Ullswater). Before joining this track through the park we will come across the beautifully situated Watermillock Church.\n\nWe continue our route around the side of Gowbarrow Fell (Airy Crag 481 m) to the National Trust Aira Force waterfall - not just the highlight of the Ullswater way but one of the Lake District’s gems. In the distance is Lyulph’s Tower – a sixteenth century castellated tower.\nFrom there we follow the narrow and uneven paths by the lake's shore from Glencoyne to Glenridding where we will stop for a break. Glencoyne Wood is famous for the ancient Deer park and where William Wordsworth sees his daffodils and being inspired, he wrote his most famous poem in 1802.\n\nThe walk then goes through the village of Patterdale passing King George V playing fields – named “the prettiest field in England” by William Wordsworth, before crossing the open valley to Side Farm and following the other shore of the lake heading north with stunning views across the lake to the Helvellyn range of mountains.\n\nWe take a narrow path towards Howtown from where we leave the lake shore and climb the last hill of Barton Fell (Arthur’s peak 532m) and explorе the impressive Cockpit Stone Circle (prehistoric monument with 27 wide stone bank) before heading back down into Pooley Bridge.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nMeeting point is outside the Post Office in Pooley Bridge which is only 6 miles (around 10 km or a 20min bus journey) from Penrith mainline train station. Meeting time - 8:45am, leaving at 9am. Postcode is CA10 2NP. Planned end time - approx 7pm. Please make sure to arrive on time as the group cannot wait for anyone late.\n\nFor bus timetable from Penrith to Pooley Bridge click here: [LINK](https://www.cumbria.gov.uk/buses/508/)\nMap of meeting point: [LINK](https://bit.ly/3nZ2phe)\n\nWe recommend you to arrive the night before and stay in the village of Pooley Bridge or Penrith with plenty of pubs, shops and B&B’s.

Nobody knows the exact origins of the Long Man carving but it's believed to date from the 1500s or 1600s. Step by step we cross several hills that reward us with splendid panoramic views along much of our trail. As we get closer to the coast, we start sensing the alluring fresh scent of the sea air and coastal views.

        "description": "This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.\n\nSummit England's highest mountain - known as the “roof of England” with sublime views into some of the Lake District’s most famous valleys.\n\nJoin us to discover why Wainwright determined this place as: “Mecca of all weary pilgrims in Lakeland, the place of many ceremonies and celebrations, of bonfires and birthday parties, the ultimate, the supreme, the one object above all others, the highest ground in England - the top of Scafell Pike”\n\nPart of the famous National 3 Peaks challenge, it’s a stunning hike with far reaching views across the Lake District and out to sea, Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man can be seen on a clear day!\n\nIt's a serious hike, being tough and steep in places. Depending on weather the route can involve scrambling over rocky terrain and requires a good fitness level and previous experience of mountain hikes\n\n**Trip Highlights**\n\n• Approx 12 to 14 attendees\n\n• Hike up one peak of the National Three Peaks Challenge - Scafell Pike\n\n• See the best of The Lake District - England's largest National park\n\n• Explore the famous glacial Langdale valley, described by John Ruskin as “…the loveliest rock scenery, chased with silver waterfalls, that I ever set foot or heart upon”\n\n• Visit Angle Tarn which according to Alfred Wainwright ranks amongst the best of Lakeland tarns with its indented shore and islets. We can come across red deer here\n\n• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man Col who has run this route many times with groups\n\n**Trip Description:**\n\nThis is a challenging hike to the summit of the highest mountain in England, Scafell Pike (978 m).\n\nThe beginning of the hike goes through Cumbria Way, a long distance path which crosses the county from Ulverston in the south to Carlisle in the north. In between the two it passes through some of the Lake District’s most famous and magnificent scenery with lakeshore paths and ancient green lanes.\n\nThen we continue with walking up Mickleden, a large glaciated valley in the shadow of a group of mountains and one of the two valleys called the Langdale Pikes which join to form Great Langdale, the other being Oxendale. Langdale is a U-shaped valley formed by glaciers, referred to by the poet Wordsworth as a “must visit valley”. Our route begins to climb up to the Rossett Pass alongside Rossett Gill via a series of wide zig-zags.\n\nThere then follows a route past Angle Tarn (lake) and eventually, we will reach a cross shelter, built from stone in the famous Esk Hause Pass. It’s a high mountain pass from which we begin the final ascent to the summit of Scafell Pike which goes between Esk Pike and Great End, giving us time to admire the views down Eskdale, one of the Lake District’s most unspoilt valleys.\n\nFrom the top of the pass, a well-trodden route takes us up onto the high ridge of the Scafells. Once on the top we will spend some time exploring the rocky summit, the result of thousands of years of glaciation. On a clear day Scotland, the Isle of Man and even Ireland in the West can be seen.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at the National Trust Car Park next to The Stickle Barn Pub (postcode LA22 9JU) at 8:45 and leave at 9am. We will meet next to the toilets which are to the left hand side of the pub.\n\nMap of meeting point: [LINK](https://bit.ly/3KmyEOD)\n\nPlease note there are two other local car parks, a small one on the right of the pub for guests of the pub and hotel and another on the opposite side of the main road through Langdale from The Stickle Barn. You can choose to park in any of the car parks (you may need £9 in coins) but the meeting point is as described above.\n\nEstimated return 6/7pm.

        "description": "The latest in our series of new hikes, this is based on the old Devils Dyke hike we did in 2013, but a much improved route finishing at Shoreham on Sea.\n\nOur trail takes us across the South Downs along elevated tracks with superb far reaching views and both into and across chalk valleys. It’s quite a varied route with sections of woodland and for much of the time we will be high up on the South Downs Hills offering far reaching views. On our route the sea slowly gets closer until we finally hit the beach at the coastal town of Shoreham by Sea.\n\nAlong our trail we visit the remains of the ancient Wolstonbury Hill Fort hill fort dating back around 3000 years to the Bronze Age - the Late Neolithic period.\n\nPlease note, this hike is hilly hence the Tough rating, the ascent is approx 600/650m which is almost as much as some of our mountain hiking days.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike in the South Downs - one of the best National Parks in the South of England\n• Visit the remains of a Bronze Age hill fort\n• Hike along the ancient Devil's Dyke valley\n• Enjoy stunning coastal views as we approach our destination by the sea\n• Explore the adorable historical town and beach of Shoreham on Sea\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start at Hassocks and our adventure takes us up onto the South Downs ridge, traversing part of the South Downs National Park, Britain's newest National Park. A 3000 year old route takes us along the top of the chalk highlands and passes by Wolstonbury Hill, a good location for wild orchid spotting with views almost as far as London. Our trail continues further along the chalk ridges of the famous South Downs Way with superb views both inland and to the sea. We then reach the Devil's Dyke, a deep valley surrounded by steep hills - one of the best view points of the South Downs where we can see The Sussex Weald and on a clear day, the Isle of Wight. It is the site of an Iron Age hillfort, and a pub. The view is so gorgeous, that a tourist railway and station was once built here just for day trippers to admire the view\n\nOur next stop is Fulking Hill, an area of bowl barrows containing archaeological remains and environmental evidence relating to the way the monument was constructed and used in the Late Neolithic and the Bronze Age. We enjoy more views from the top of the slope at Truleigh Hill, picked out by its distinctive masts, with the crown of trees on Chanctonbury Ring further on.\n\nThe South Downs reward us with yet more fantastic and far reaching panoramas as we approach the sea on our way past the tiny Shoreham airport - the oldest commercial airport in the world with a protected 1936 art deco terminal building that plays host to many films including \"The Da Vinci Code\", Agatha Christie's \"Poirot\" and \"Woman in Gold\". We finish our hike in the historic fishing town of Shoreham on Sea for a well earned drink and rest.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:45am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.\n\nWe meet between WHSmith (no 34) and Nero Express (no 29) - [MAP LINK](https://bit.ly/3vR4Sfx)\n\nPlanned arrival time back into London is 6:58pm (we have a group train ticket and you are committed for the day until then)\n\n**Food**\n\nWe'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

        "description": "Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England\n\n• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed\n\n• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike\n\n• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town\n\n• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThis hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.\n\nOur hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

Please keep at least 3 metres away from the edges. If you fall, or the ground at the edge of the cliff collapses it will almost certainly be fatal.",

        "description": "Come and join us for what is our most popular day hike and the most exhilarating coastal hike in the South East of England, with breathtaking views of the striking and dramatic white cliffs. A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England\n\n• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed\n\n• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike\n\n• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town\n\n• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThis hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.\n\nOur hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

Please keep at least 3 metres away from the edges. If you fall, or the ground at the edge of the cliff collapses it will almost certainly be fatal.",

This diverse and stunning hike takes us on a journey via Knole House, Knole Deer Park and Ightham Mote.

The videos went on to be selected by New York's MoMA as two of the most influential music videos of the late 1960s.\n\nKnole House is one of England's largest houses boasting 365 rooms and 52 staircases and has remained surprisingly unchanged during its history going back to 1486. Being surrounded by the glorious 1000 acre Knole Deer Park completes its picturesque setting.\n\nWe also pass Ightham Mote, a largely original moated medieval manor house dating back to 1320 and described by David Starkey as \"one of the most beautiful and interesting of English country houses\". It has an extensive history encompassing ownership from medieval knights to courtiers to Henry VIII.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Charing Cross station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:55am train.

You can even get a zip wire experience on the seafront. We will have some time to enjoy the pebble beach, and if you're feeling really in the seaside mood, grab some good old British Fish and Chips.

Before that we will pass through the cosy village of Ditchling, then stand atop Ditchling Beacon, explore the green expanse of the Stanmer Park, pass Stanmer House, then walk through the University of Sussex campus to Falmer. We will enjoy a lovely view of the sea from Kemp Town Racecourse and then walk into the splendour that is Brighton.

We're off to historic Arundel in Sussex and breaking with tradition we'll also have a brief stop mid hike at a delightful little pub on the banks of the river Arun for that irresistible sneaky river side pint to satisfy the Outdoor Alcoholics.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike the chalk hills with breathtaking views to the distant sea\n\n• Explore the landscaped Arundel Park with its woodland, Swanbourne lake, meadows and the Gothic Hiorne Tower\n\n• Superb views of the 12th century Arundel Castle\n\n• Follow the river Arun on a picturesque trail towards Arundel Castle\n\n• Visit the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral (French Gothic style)\n\n• Riverside pub visit\n\n• Visit the well preserved Sussex ancient market town of Arundel\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nA delightful mix of scenery with a good stretch along the river Arun, a visit to the woods and hills of Arundel Park and the striking and extravagant castellated Hiorne tower. We'll then venture into Arundel with its Gothic and enchanting castle dominating and looming over the town to finish our hike by finding the mighty Arundel Cathedral. We'll get some far off and ever nearing views of the castle as we follow the meandering and lazy river Arun. As well as the quick mid hike pub stop we'll have our usual refreshments in Arundel before making our way back to London. We'll pop up to hike past Arundel Cathedral but sadly can't get into the grounds or very close to Arundel Castle as admission is charged.\n\nWith just under 2500 inhabitants Arundel is a small town, but has been home to the very rich and powerful Dukes of Norfolk for over 400 years. The original Mott and Bailey castle was built on the site in 1067 by the Normans after their invasion of Britain in 1066 and has since been rebuilt and expanded to provide the grand modern day stately home. The castle is still inhabited by the Dukes of Norfolk with the 18th Duke residing there currently. Hiorne Tower was built in Arundel Park in 1787 as an extravagant folly for the Duke of Norfolk and has a commanding position high on the hills and is quite enchanting and captivating.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:20am for the 9:35am train.

        "description": "Join us on a journey to hikers' paradise - Georgia. Nestled on the edge of Europe and Asia, it’s known as \"the Balcony of Europe\" and holds a unique mixture of diverse scenery - from the highest peaks of the continent to gentle vine clad valleys and ancient settlements. A country with ancient traditions and warm hearted people that is believed to be the birthplace of wine.\n\nExperience the essence of Georgia on this week long trip in the heart of the Great Caucasus Mountains. Dive into the unspoiled beauty of the Svaneti - hike to giant glaciers, admire the mesmerising alpine Koruldi lakes, and visit the highest permanently inhabited UNESCO village in Europe. We will be staying in the mountain town of Mestia that has best preserved the colourful Georgian culture and heritage and we will visit the vibrant town of Kutaisi, which is also one of the oldest towns in Europe.\n\nTrip Highlights:\n\n• Visit Georgia - the birthplace of wine and home to Europe’s highest mountain\n\n• Reach the highest permanently inhabited village in Europe - the ancient Ushguli\n\n• Hike to the magnificent Ushba waterfall - towering at 2200m above sea level\n\n• Hike to two mountain glaciers\n\n• Explore the medieval Svaneti region - a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\n• Reach the base of Georgia’s highest peak at 2400m\n\n• Visit Kutaisi - one of the oldest towns in Europe with reminders of Russian and Ottoman conquests\n\n• A fine balance between hiking and culture to fully experience the magic of Georgia\n\n• A small group limited to just 16 with 2 English speaking local Georgian Mountain Guides to keep it really special\n\nPhotos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics\n\nHoliday Description\n\nMountainous, warm, colourful and vibrant is the best way to describe Georgia. Caught between two worlds, the country is a spectacular blend of European and Middle Eastern culture with immense natural diversity.\n\nWe have chosen the spectacular UNESCO listed mountain region of Svaneti that is preserved in time due to its isolated location surrounded by the Great Caucasus Mountains. We will venture to the base of the highest peak in Georgia, admire Chalaadi and Shkhara glaciers and explore the picturesque village of Ushguli dating back to the 9th century. We'll also enjoy the reflection of the snow capped mountains in the mirror like Koruldi lakes and hike to one of the highest waterfalls in Georgia.\n\nAmazing Georgia keeps so many treasures that it deserves a full week to truly experience it all - hike around spectacular untouched scenery while also getting a taste of the amazing local cuisine and hospitality. Let's not forget the unique wine tradition dating 8000 years back.\n\nImportant Notes\n\nAlthough this trip is designed as a mixture of varied hiking and sightseeing, some of the hikes involve long descents on steep ground and also some rough and uneven walking on rocks and boulders. There are some tough and long uphill/downhill sections and this trip is only suitable for hikers with experience of mountain hiking. Hiking boots ideally with ankle protection are essential due to the uneven and rocky terrain on some hikes.\n\nITINERARY\n\nSunday 11th September\n\nArrive at Kutaisi airport around midnight. Complimentary transfer to the accommodation in Kutaisi for the night.\n\nMonday 12th September\n\nOur first day of exploration begins with a scenic drive through the majestic mountains towards the ancient town of Mestia - the historical and cultural centre of the Svaneti region. On our way we'll stop by the Enguri Dam - the second highest dam in Europe (271m). Enguri Dam is the first of several photo opportunities that await us. We’ll also visit a colourful local market.\n\nTuesday 13th September\n\nTuesday’s hike: Chalaadi Glacier\nDistance: 3.8 miles (6km)\nAscent: 200m\nGrading: Beginners\nHiking time: About 3 hours\n\nToday we are hiking to the spectacular Chalaadi Glacier that lies in a valley with jagged Caucasus Mountains peaks towering high above. We hike through tranquil green pine forests before we venture into a glacial valley. We reach an altitude of 1850m to see the Chalaadi Glacier - a fascinating treat for the eye and the source of a rushing glacial river. This is a fairly easy hike with a few rocky sections that allows us to fully relish and take in the surrounding scenery.\nWeather dependent, there's a possibility for a cable car ride with a view of Ushba and also to visit a traditional Svan fortified tower.\n\nWednesday 14th September\n\nWednesday’s hike: Koruldi lakes\nDistance: 10 miles (16km)\nAscent: 1400m\nGrading: Challenging/Mountain\nHiking time: About 7 to 8 hours\n\nOur next conquest are the beautiful alpine Koruldi lakes - nestled at the foot of the 4710m high Ushba peak, known as the \"Matterhorn of the Great Caucasus Mountains\" for its spire shaped double summit. Our hike follows a steep path that elevates to an awe inspiring view point at 2500m. On our way we pass green forests and lush meadows followed by the idyllic sounds of cow bells. It’s one of the most challenging trails in the area and tough, but extremely rewarding with breathtaking vistas of the surrounding Great Caucasus Mountains.\n\nThursday 15th September\n\nThursday’s hike: Ushba Waterfalls\nDistance: 5 miles (8km)\nAscent: 400m\nGrading: Intermediate\nHiking time: About 4 to 5 hours\n\nToday our hike leads us to one of the highest waterfalls in Georgia - Ushba.

We'll admire the gushing river and enjoy the view over the ice mass and towards the summit. If you feel adventurous you can do part of the hike the genuine Georgian way - by horse (optional extra activity).\n\nSaturday 17th September\n\nAfter breakfast we head back to Kutaisi for our last night in Georgia.\n\nSunday 18th September\n\nBreakfast marks the end of our adventure and you have some free time to explore Kutaisi.

        "description": "Are you ready to escape with us on this short weekend adventure to the mesmerizing Triglav National Park, hike upto Triglav summit with professional Slovenian mountain guides doing via ferrata on the way?\n\nWelcome to the captivating Julian Alps where we embark upon an unforgettable adventure to summit Slovenia’s highest peak - the mighty Mount Triglav (2864m). The locals claim that one is considered ‘’a true Slovenian’’ only after they have reached the peak at least once in their lifetime. You may not need to become ‘’a true Slovenian’’ but Mount Triglav is definitely worth being crossed from your bucket list as is seeing the iconic Lake Bled, which we stay nearby.\n\nONLY 1 DAY OFF WORK REQUIRED - This trip is designed as a short break, perfect for fit adventurers who are keen to challenge themselves and feel the via ferrata thrill.\n\nTrip Highlights:\n\n• Climb the highest peak and symbol of Slovenia, Mount Triglav - considered a rite of passage for locals\n\n• Explore Triglav National Park - the only National Park in Slovenia and one of the oldest in Europe\n\n• Spend a night in a Mountain Hut on our journey to the summit\n\n• Enjoy the naturally wild and untamed nature of the Julian Alps\n\n• Bask on the fairytale shores and deep blue waters of the glacial Lake Bled\n\n• Visit Bled medieval Castle - the oldest castle in Slovenia and symbol of Bled\n\n• Short trip easy to be extended, should you want to stay in Bled extra days\n\nPhotos - Most photos were taken by our guides on the trip\n\nClick here to join our Facebook community: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/\n\nHoliday Description\n\nWelcome to Slovenia - the first officially Certified Green country in the world and a not so hidden gem anymore but actually a very popular destination among tourists and more specifically among hikers wanting to conquer the epic Mount Triglav - the highest peak in the Julian Alps.\n\nOur journey starts from Ljubljana airport from where we will be taken by a private transfer to our accommodation in the picturesque town of Bled. Then, we will meet our hosts, check-in and have the rest of the day free to explore Bled. Do not miss out on the opportunity to visit the famous glacier Lake Bled - despite being Slovenia’s star tourist attraction, it remains unspoiled with crystal blue waters and a delightfully peaceful atmosphere. While there, do not forget the mighty Bled Castle which has been firmly standing at the top of 130 meters high steep cliff for over thousand years. Considered the oldest castles in the area, nowadays Lake Bled Castle is the most visited tourist gem that offers beautiful views of the lake and its small island, the Alpine town and the surrounding landscape with the peaks of the Julian Alps.\n\nOn the next two days, our adventure continues. We head off to the starting point of our hike - Krma Valley and from there towards our main destination - Mount Triglav. We will go through gentle paths, thick forests and green meadows while keeping our eyes open for the huge variety of wildlife that calls this area home, including griffon vultures, golden eagles and lynx. In the afternoon, we will reach Kredarica hut where we will spend the night and gather strength for the last challenge - the last 350m via ferrata route which will finally bring us on the top of Slovenia.\n\nImportant Notes\n\nThe hike is tough and a challenging activity with a demanding climb to the summit of the mountain. It also requires a high level of endurance and can be challenging for those, who are not used to longer hikes. The climb to the summit of Mt.

        "description": "This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.\n\nJoin us for a daring hike to the Yorkshire Three Peaks! One of the toughest and most adventurous routes in England covering a distance of 40km and summiting 3 mountains in one day!\n\nThe hike offers spectacular far reaching views and challenging rugged terrain and is set within the breathtaking Yorkshire Dales National Park. The route climbs a total of about 1500m of ascent with a few steep sections.\n\nThis is the toughest and most challenging hike Outdooraholics do in the UK and is not for beginners!\n\nFor further details on this trip please see our Yorkshire 3 Peaks PDF- [LINK](https://outdooraholics.co.uk/Yorkshire3Peaks.pdf)\n\nTo check in to the Yorkshire Three Peaks Facebook page: [LINK](https://www.facebook.com/YorkshireThreePeaksChallenge)\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Undertake this famous and formidable 40km hilly challenge\n\n• Small group of just 14 hikers\n\n• Build your own weekend trip around this day hike\n\n• Challenging hiking experience in the beautiful Yorkshire Dales National Park\n\n• Climb Whernside - the highest peak in the Yorkshire Dales at 736m\n\n• Enjoy spectacular views across the Yorkshire Dales National Park - on a clear day we can also see the Lake District and the sea\n\n• Hike guided by a qualified Mountain Leader and Mountain Rescue Man who has run this route many times with groups\n\n• The perfect challenge to set yourself for 2020 or great training for anyone doing big hikes like Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp or Mount Toubkal\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThe three peaks to be climbed are Pen-y-ghent (694m), Whernside (736m) and Ingleborough (723m) with each peak offering a different degree of difficulty. We will do the most popular hike starting in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale and the hike is around 25 miles (40km) long with a total of about 1500m of ascent.\n\nThe ascent of Ingleborough passes large areas of limestone rock before the path gets steeper and rockier as we reach the flat summit with its ancient fortifications and views across Morecambe Bay and on a clear day the Lake District. A steep descent eventually leads to the hamlet of Chapel le Dale and the gradual climb to the top of the second peak, Whernside (736m), the highest point in North Yorkshire. The route back down takes us alongside one of the wonders of the industrial revolution, Ribblehead viaduct (built in 1874, 400m wide and using 1.5 million bricks)! There now follows a long hike through fantastic limestone scenery before a steep climb up to the top of Pen y Ghent and then a quick drop down the front (with some easy scrambling) back to Horton. A very fine challenge and also a superb hike.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Horton car park at 6:45am (20m south of BD24 0HF on B6479) and leave at 7am prompt - please buy a parking ticket to cover all day.

Please contact people via this forum and post there if you can offer or need a lift or plan to hire a car and can offer spaces.\n\nThis trip is viable on public transport, you can check the train from London Kings Cross to Horton-in-Ribblesdale which runs about every two hours (and it's approximately a 4-hour-ride). For further details: [LINK](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/)\n\nThat train station is 5 minutes walk from the meeting point. You could arrive the night before and stay in the village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale. Because the hike often takes 10 to 12 hours or more, it may be more suitable to stay another night and return the following day if you're travelling by train.\n\n**Food**\n\nWe'll stop during the hike for a snack lunch so please bring food and drink.

A good proportion of the hike is up high on the cliffs as they loom down over the sea beneath. We're off to Sussex to hike the classic Seven Sisters hike from Seaford to Eastbourne, a hike Outdooraholics have been organising for nearly 9 years and have had over 85 wonderful trips here. It is epic!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike one of the most spectacular coastal hikes in England\n\n• A great physical challenge with several easy options to shorten if needed\n\n• Enjoy amazing views over the coastline for much of this hike\n\n• Finish in Eastbourne - England's sunniest town\n\n• Explore the South Downs National Park - the newest in the UK\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nThis hike treats us with many iconic views and fresh sea air high up on the cliffs. The Seven Sisters are a series of white chalk cliffs and are set within the Seven Sisters Country Park. They are remnants of dry valleys in the South Downs and were formed at the end of the last Ice Age by glacial meltwater. There are in fact now eight sisters as an extra one has been created by coastal erosion.\n\nOur hike starts in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times. It then follows the cliffs along the South Downs way past Birling Gap and the Belle Tout lighthouse. The lighthouse was actually moved 17 metres in 1999 to stop it from falling victim to coastal erosion. Our hike shall then take us on to the beauty spot of Beachy Head which has a more sinister side, before we head to Eastbourne for some refreshments in a delightful pub.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:54am train.

        "description": "Come and join us for this hike that takes us on a trail through both Sussex and Kent as we explore two counties. We pass the ancient rock formations of Harrison’s Rocks which owe their dramatic and striking shape to the last ice age. As we wander around below the crag surrounded by a lush woodland we’ll admire the majestic beauty of the sandstone formations. Our hike then continues across the border into the beautiful scenery of Kent - the Garden of England. On our way we will explore historical manors with enchanted forests, follow lazy, meandering rivers and indulge our senses with lush countryside.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Visit the famous Harrison’s Rocks formed over 135 million years ago and shaped by the last Ice Age\n\n• Explore two beautiful counties in one day - Kent and Sussex\n\n• Pass a famous manor house dated back to the 1200s\n\n• See the majestic Harrison Rocks which are a Site of Special Scientific Interest\n\n• Be surrounded by a variety of wildlife species including rare plants\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start off in the idyllic village of Eridge, nestled in the northern borderlands of East Sussex next to Kent. Following the picturesque views across the Kent and Sussex countryside. Our trail reveals and abundance of lush countryside demonstrating why Kent is known as the Garden of England, bright and open woodlands including Broadwater forest are home to abundant wildlife. We’ll then hike to the impressive Harrison’s rocks - a collection of rock outcrops that date back about 135 million years but that owe their dramatic and striking shapes to the last Ice Age. They're extremely popular with climbers who we're likely to see.\n\nOur delightful rural hike continues on to the truly stunning Kentish scenery. Much of this section goes through very peaceful countryside with a remote feeling. We pass the well-known moated manor of Groombridge which has a rich history of over 700 years. The manor house as well as the bridges and moat gates were largely designed by Sir Christopher Wren, known for his redesign of St Paul’s Cathedral, following the Great Fire of London in 1666. From here we will dive into serene shady woods of Kent where we can quiet our minds and enjoy the scenic beauty of the countryside. Our hike finishes back to Eridge where we will have a well-deserved rest and drinks before we head home.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at London Bridge station at 8:40am leaving the meeting point at 8:55am for the 9:07am train.

        "description": "Hike designed for beginners!\n\nWoodland, attractive towns, castles, river trails and chalk hills. This hike has a bit of nearly everything. We're off to historic Arundel in Sussex and breaking with tradition we'll also have a brief stop mid hike at a delightful little pub on the banks of the river Arun for that irresistible sneaky river side pint to satisfy the Outdoor Alcoholics.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike the chalk hills with breathtaking views to the distant sea\n\n• Explore the landscaped Arundel Park with its woodland, Swanbourne lake, meadows and the Gothic Hiorne Tower\n\n• Superb views of the 12th century Arundel Castle\n\n• Follow the river Arun on a picturesque trail towards Arundel Castle\n\n• Visit the Roman Catholic Arundel Cathedral (French Gothic style)\n\n• Riverside pub visit\n\n• Visit the well preserved Sussex ancient market town of Arundel\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nA delightful mix of scenery with a good stretch along the river Arun, a visit to the woods and hills of Arundel Park and the striking and extravagant castellated Hiorne tower. We'll then venture into Arundel with its Gothic and enchanting castle dominating and looming over the town to finish our hike by finding the mighty Arundel Cathedral. We'll get some far off and ever nearing views of the castle as we follow the meandering and lazy river Arun. As well as the quick mid hike pub stop we'll have our usual refreshments in Arundel before making our way back to London. We'll pop up to hike past Arundel Cathedral but sadly can't get into the grounds or very close to Arundel Castle as admission is charged.\n\nWith just under 2500 inhabitants Arundel is a small town, but has been home to the very rich and powerful Dukes of Norfolk for over 400 years. The original Mott and Bailey castle was built on the site in 1067 by the Normans after their invasion of Britain in 1066 and has since been rebuilt and expanded to provide the grand modern day stately home. The castle is still inhabited by the Dukes of Norfolk with the 18th Duke residing there currently. Hiorne Tower was built in Arundel Park in 1787 as an extravagant folly for the Duke of Norfolk and has a commanding position high on the hills and is quite enchanting and captivating.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 9am leaving the meeting point at 9:20am for the 9:35am train.

        "description": "Trip FULL.\n\nThis trip does not include transportation.\n\nA gem of a trip for those with previous mountain experience. Outdooraholics are going to a world-class destination for climbers and hikers, one of the top-rated tourist attractions in Scotland and one of the most magical and stunning mountainous hiking locations in Europe, the world-renowned Isle of Skye.\n\nKnown for its rugged and dramatic landscapes, stunning coastal views, medieval castles, and archaeological sites, picturesque fishing villages, its wealth of history, geology, and outstanding scenery - Skye is a hiker’s paradise! Skye is also a haven for wildlife - from spotting red deer to white-tailed sea eagles and the loveable “hairy coos”.\n\nTrip Highlights:\n\n• A day hiking the rugged and dramatic Cuillins Mountain Range\n\n• A 2nd and tough hiking day which time and group permitting we plan to do two hikes:\nExploring the Old Man of Storr - considered as the symbol of the island and the highest point of the Trotternish peninsula. Our 2nd hike will be up The Quiraing - the northernmost summit of the Trotternish, offering arguably the most beautiful panoramas of Skye.\n\n• Stay in the coastal town and capital of Skye - Portree\n\n• Take on an optional seal watching boat trip\n\n• Visit the iconic Eilean Donan Castle set on a small, rocky island\n\n• A smallish group trip of 18 hikers, led by an ex Mountain Rescue man and qualified Mountain Leader who knows this area very well - Col\n\n• Staying in a hotel with twin-bedded rooms\n\nPhotos - Most photos were taken by our guides on the trip\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU8P9N0lhXs\n\nClick here to join our Facebook community:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/\n\nHoliday Description\n\nThe Isle of Skye is an iconic landscape and has featured in countless films such as Highlander, Stardust, Prometheus, The Wickerman, and 47 Ronin.\n\nThe largest of the Inner Hebrides islands in the Scottish Highlands, Skye has a wealth of history ranging from 165 million years old Dinosaur Footprints, prehistoric sites, and majestic geological features to tales of Bonnie Prince Charlie, rivalling clans and the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. Skye is steeped in myth, legend and immense natural beauty.\n\nThe Isle of Skye is the 2nd largest island of Scotland and conveniently has a road bridge to it, so no ferries are required. With a population of just 6 people per square kilometre though it is very sparsely inhabited with little of the island being built up and vast expanses for us to hike.\n\nWe have lined up some superb hikes, they are tough and do require both a high level of fitness and also previous experience of tough mountain hiking. If you are in any doubt please contact us before booking as sadly there are no easy or intermediate hike options.\n\nWe are staying in the capital of the island Portree, which gives us an ideal base from which to explore as well as being a gorgeous coastal town with many good pubs and restaurants where we can enjoy our evenings and sample the local whiskies (Talisker comes from the island). We can also sample some of the local delicacies such as Haggis.\n\nOn our last day, we will have a chance to visit the iconic Eilean Donan Castle as well as an optional seal watching boat trip.\n\nITINERARY\n\nFriday 23rd September\n\nArriving in the evening at the hotel, time for socialising. Our guide will be around to meet and greet you and for those arriving before 7pm we will head out for dinner in Portree.\n\nSaturday 24th September\n\nHike: Sgurr na Stri from Sligachan (Cuillins Mountain Range)\nDistance: approx 23 km\nAscent: 650 metres\nGrading: Challenging/tough - click here for details:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\nDuration: approx 8 to 10h total hiking time\n\nSkye has the most jagged and extreme mountains in the UK and these are mainly located in the south in an area called The Cuillins, also an area home to the Golden Eagle. This is where our hike will be based today.\n\nThis long round-trip hike goes straight between the two ranges of the Cuillins and is a fantastic introduction to the mountains of Skye. We take in the summit of Sgurr na Stri (from gaelic for the “Mountain of Strife”) and we pass hiking locations where all the mountain photographers go to get the best shots of the Skye mountains.\n\nPlease be aware that the walk is long and may involve steep gradients, boggy and rocky sections.\n\nSunday 25th September\n\nHike: We plan to do both hikes - the Old man Storr and Quiraing\nTotal distance: 18 km (Old man Storr - 8.5 km/The Quiraing - 9 km)\nTotal ascent: 1180m total for both hikes (580m and 600m)\nGrading: Challenging/tough - click here for details:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\nTotal duration: 9-11h (4-5h/5-6h)\n\nWe will head over for a lower level hike in the morning followed by another hike in the afternoon - giving you the option of doing just the morning one if you like or joining both. The first hike will feature The Old Man Storr, being probably the most famous point of interest in Skye. It is a 50-metre tall vertical rock, a monolith reminiscent of a man’s head and has served as a landmark for sailors for centuries. The site is marvellous and offers astonishing viewpoints over the Trotternish peninsula.\n\nThe afternoon hike will continue with Quiraing - one of Britain’s largest landslides and an iconic landscape. Its name comes from a Norse word and means “round fold”, a reminder of Skye's Viking history. It is said that islanders once used this dramatic, otherworldly landscape to hide their cattle from Viking raiders.\n\nIf you only do one of the walks, this will give you a half-day to do as you please and get a list with some options of things to do/explore, provided by our guide.\nAt the end of the day, to recover from the hike, our guide will take you to one of the numerous bars in Portree where you can enjoy impromptu live Scottish music performances from local musicians. Music is a significant aspect of the nation's culture.\nIn case of a clear night, we might have a stargazing night out.\n\nMonday 26th September\n\nPlan: Eilean Donan Castle visit and a seal watching boat trip\nDuration: 5-7h total inc driving\n\nWe will visit Eilean Donan castle. Eilean is one of the most recognised castles in Scotland, a perfect photography spot, rich in history.\nThis very famous iconic Scottish monument has been used as a filming location in numerous movies - Highlander, Entrapment, The World is Not Enough etc.\n\nThere is then an optional boat trip taking us to seal watching and we aim to finish around mid afternoon.\n\nCost and Payment\n\nThe trip is £415 per person.

Time seems to have stood still in this area and even the village of Hurley is little changed since the days when it was a Benedictine Monastery. We also get a glimpse of Bisham Abbey and Bisham Church across the River Thames before we cross over the weir footbridge at Hambleden Mill (61m wide and an experience in itself). After a short stop here, we follow an enchanting woodland trail passing meadows back to Marlow.\n\nThe beauty and tranquillity of the area has attracted numerous famous residents including Mary Shelley (the author of \"Frankenstein\"), T.S.Eliot, Heston Blumenthal, Andrew Strauss and even Robbie Williams and David Seaman own properties there.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Paddington station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:57am train.

        "eventUrl": "https://www.meetup.com/outdooraholics/events/286544605",
        "description": "Welcome to the captivating Atlas Mountains where we embark upon a high altitude adventure to summit North Africa’s highest mountain peak - the mighty Jebel Toubkal (4167m). Admire the rugged beauty of the Moroccan Atlas mountain range while immersed in the traditional Moroccan culture in a spectacular long weekend of tough and exhilarating hiking. A short trip especially developed for fit adventurers keen to challenge themselves and hike up North Africa’s highest summit and enjoy traditional Berber hospitality. And to top it all off we’ve added a night in Marrakech at a central Moroccan style hotel.\n\nThis trip is also great training for Kilimanjaro and Nepal - it's tough and a perfect first adventure into high altitude peaks.\n\nONLY 1 DAY OFF WORK REQUIRED - long weekend adventure\n\nThis trip is run with local Mountain guides and has been designed and planned especially for Outdooraholics so that you will have the chance to explore the area on a much deeper level as well as to truly experience its beauty and uniqueness with the help of the local guides.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Incredible short break and hiking to the top of Mt Toubkal (4167m) in the magnificent Atlas mountains\n\n• Experience Berber hospitality at Toubkal Mountain Refuge\n\n• Taste traditional Moroccan cuisine\n\n• See a traditional Berber mountain village in the High Atlas Mountains\n\n• Stay at a basic but well located hotel in the heart of Marrakech\n\n• Short trip easy to be extended, should you want to stay in Morocco extra days\n\n• As with all of our foreign trips we keep numbers small, intimate and fun and this trip is limited to just 13 hikers!\n\nVideo - [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=likYuoqDx2E)\n\n**Holiday Description**\n\nOn this 3 day Moroccan exploration, we will challenge ourselves with an ascent of Jebel Toubkal (4167m) nestled in the Atlas Mountain Range and the highest mountain in North Africa. We’ll experience Berber culture and Moroccan cuisine in Toubkal Mountain refuge before we hike to the summit. We then have time to explore Marrakech and stay in a centrally located basic hotel.\n\nThe Toubkal adventure in the High Atlas starts from the Marrakech airport - we’ll be picked up and driven to Imlil village where our hike begins. Once our luggage is loaded on the mules, we begin the ascent to the Toubkal Mountain Refuge (3207m) where we’ll spend our first night high in the mountains. Next morning is the exhilarating climbing of Mt Toubkal followed by descent down to the refuge for lunch. After our meal we descend to Imlil and get a transfer to Marrakech for our hotel stay in the heart of the city. In the evening you’ll have some time on your hands for a stroll around central Marrakech and a bit of exploration.\n\nAn exceptional long weekend packed with stunning landscapes, rich Moroccan culture and local cuisine.\n\nThis location is so great that Sir Richard Branson has bought a villa here and we actually met him on the trails in October 2017.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\nAlthough it’s a short trip, these are very tough mountain hikes on steep paths with rocks and boulders for long sections and on the second day about 10 to 12 hours of solid hiking. There are also long ascents and descents. This is a trip only suitable for very fit and experienced hikers. This is our toughest hiking trip.\n\nHiking boots with ankle protection are essential due to the rough, uneven and rocky terrain - you will have to climb over boulders and rocks. You should be prepared for early starts and late finishes, this trip is exhilarating but exhausting and is not for everyone.\n\n**Altitude Warning**\n\nPlease note that we are hiking to a high altitude which affects everyone differently, you may get some mild signs of altitude sickness. We are spending our first night at the Neltner Refuge which is at 3207m and will help with acclimatisation. The following day we hike to the summit (approx 1000m ascent) and on reaching the summit we will usually descend within about 15 to 30 minutes. There are tablets available that you can buy in advance to help reduce or eliminate the effects of altitude sickness - we cannot advise on this but please see your doctor for details. Should you experience signs of Acute Mountain Sickness like headaches, nausea, dizziness or breathing difficulties, you should consult your guide immediately and you may need to descend back to the Mountain Hut, although this is rare.\n\n\\*Please note that your luggage while hiking will be transferred by mules. Therefore, there is a luggage limit of 15kg per person, but about 10kg should be aimed for and please pack into a large rucksack (no suitcases or hard bags please).\n\n**ITINERARY**\n\nSaturday\n\nHike: Imlil to Toubkal (Neltner) Refuge\nDistance: 8 miles (12km)\nGrading: [Tough - Mountain - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings)\nAscent: 1500m\nHiking time: Approx 5 to 6 hours\n\nOur private transfer will pick us up from Marrakech Menara Airport and take us to the village of Imlil. At Imlil we’ll load our luggage on the mules and start our hike having lunch about 1 hour in. Rising through the secluded Atlas mountains and through several picturesque passes, we will reach the small traditional Mountain Refuge under the top of Mt Toubkal - Neltner Refuge (3207m), where we will spend the night. Please note: The Refuge is a mountain hut and is basic accommodation in large mixed gender dormitories with bunk beds. Food here is very simple.\n\nSunday\n\nHike: Toubkal (Neltner) Refuge - Mt Toubkal - Imlil\nDistance: 13 miles (21km)\nGrading: [Tough - Mountain - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings)\nAscent: 1000m\nDescent: 2468m\nHiking time: Approx 10 to 12 hours\n\nToday we make the ascent of Mt Toubkal (4167m). We wake at about 3:00am and after a quick breakfast we start our ascent in dark aiming to hit the summit to see sunrise, which depends on the group pace. Passing boulders and accompanied by magnificent views of several peaks, in 3 to 4 hours of walking we arrive at the distinctive metal tripod which marks the summit. The summit rewards with spectacular views on every side - we’ll see incredible high Atlas peaks and admire stunning views of the Atlas range along with far-reaching views towards the Sahara Desert - truly memorable sights.\n\nDescending Toubkal, we come down to the Refuge for lunch and then to Imlil, where we get a transfer back to Marrakech for our hotel stay and an evening to explore Marrakech. Please note, the hotel in Marrakech is a basic but well located guest house. Please don't expect Western Europe Hotel standards.\n\nMonday\n\nOur long weekend trip ends after breakfast. Should you want to stay more days, feel free to arrange these for yourself. You could also book a later flight in the evening to spend another day in Marrakech. Alternatively it works well to come out on Friday, have time in Marrakech and then meet the group on Saturday.\n\nDiscussion forum - [LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53605916/)\n\n**Cost & Payment**\n\nThe trip is £260 per person.

        "description": "We’re off to the North Downs in Surrey - an area so spectacular it’s been designated an official Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This hike starts at the charming historic town of Guildford which has a long and varied history dating back thousands of years to the Bronze Age and more recently to the castle that the Normans built 1000 years ago.\n\nOur hike reveals lush countryside, bright and open woodlands and follows the River Wey Canal - we go beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings for which Guildford is famed. We visit an enchanting ancient church nestling on St Martha’s Hill with breathtaking panoramic views almost as far as the sea. We then finish in Guildford to get a glimpse of this picture postcard town that’s just a 35 minute train journey from London.\n\nThis hike was designed and written by one of our hike leaders who was born and lived in Guildford and we show you its undiscovered gems!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Explore the beautiful Surrey countryside Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\n• Admire the far reaching views of St Martha's hill with its historic church\n\n• Visit Guildford - Surrey's most significant ancient town with Bronze Age roots and see for yourself why it has attracted many famous residents.\n\n• Follow the tranquil River Wey as it gently flows past willow trees through rural Surrey\n\n• Visit the enchanting ruins of the 14th century St Catherine's Chapel - which attracted the artist Turner to paint it in 1807 and 1808\n\n• Hike along part of the North Downs Way - the 2nd most acclaimed long distance route in South East England\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nGuildford is best known for being a picturesque and quaint market town near London, but the countryside has far more to offer than most visitors discover beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings. Famous past and current residents include Lewis Carroll - author of Alice in Wonderland, Jodie Kidd, Alan Turin, Terry Jones (the Monty Python writer) and Yvonne Arnaud. William Turner came to paint St Catherine's Church in 1707 and 1708 and his paintings now hang in the Tate Gallery.\n\nOnce in Guildford we hike along the picturesque River Wey canal where the nestled boat houses sit on this tranquil waterway leading us to the ruin of St Catherine's church. We then hike into Bluebell Woods where we join the ancient North Downs Way path along a ridge which has far reaching views. At the top of the hill we come to the remote and isolated St Martha’s church built in the 12th century.\n\nFrom here there are spectacular views to the south – as far as the South Downs by Brighton and indeed on a clear day you can see seven counties from this point. We then go onto Chilworth which was home to an extensive gunpowder factory built by the East India Company in 1626, although it was closed in 1920 and is now an enchanting derelict site covering 27 acres with much to see including relics, tramways and buildings from its nearly 400 year history.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Waterloo station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.\n\nWe meet under the main central clock.

        "description": "Come and join us for a gorgeous hike across the chalk ridge of the South Downs hills on a route from Hassocks to Lewes. We are travelling so far from London, we are able to see the coast from parts of this hike.\n\nIf you enjoy rolling hills, panoramic views stretching to the sea, rivers, windmills, Iron Age hill forts, and picturesque trails through beautiful rural Sussex, you have just found the perfect hike.

Step by step we reach a dramatic panoramic view stretching to the English Channel, with Brighton perching gently in the foreground on the coast.\n\nOur adventure continues further along the northern edge of the South Downs with superb views inland until we reach Ditchling Beacon. The latter was the site of an Iron Age hill fort and is the third highest point in the South East of England at 248m and consequently has fabulous views across the Weald up to the North Downs Way. It was also the location of one of the Beacons that warned of the Spanish Armada in 1588. After a couple more peaks we drop down to follow the River Ouse into Lewes. We are welcomed into the old part of the town by a dramatic hike through the Castle Gate - the castle originally built by William the Conqueror in 1069 after his invasion of Britain.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at London Bridge station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9:09am train.

        "description": "Join us and visit the desert of dreams - an exhilarating place everyone should see once! We all know the Sahara from films - vast, awe inspiring and desolate with a natural and pure beauty. Roughly the size of the United States and 4800km long, it is the largest hot desert in the world. Whilst it conjures up images of camels trekking across the sun baked sand dunes, there is so much more to the desert and this area than just sand and camels! We visit a breath taking fortified village, stay in Ouarzazate, visit the Dades Gorge, camp under the stars after watching the sun set whilst listening to Berber music, take a road trip on a mountain pass over the High Atlas mountains and finish our trip in Marrakesh to experience this vibrant and buzzing capital city.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Spend a night in the desert under the stars\n\n• Trek through the desert Bedouin style on a camel\n\n• Enjoy a night in Marrakech to savour the buzzing capital city\n\n• Pass over the High Atlas Mountains via Tizi- N-Tichka pass (2260m)\n\n• Visit the UNESCO World Heritage site of Ait Ben Haddou - a historic fortified village\n\n• Local English speaking guide\n\n• Pass through the Valley of the roses\n\n• Trek from Tamnalt Hills (Hill of Human Bodies) to Dades gorge, and marvel at the ancient rock creations\n\n• Small group trip limited to just 12\n\n**Important Notes**\n\nDriving - please note, due to the remoteness of the Sahara desert there is a lot of driving both to get there and also back.\n\n**ITINERARY**\n\nThursday - drive from Marrakesh to Ouarzazate\n\nLeave from Marrakech early and drive towards Ouarzazate, pass through the famous Valley of the Roses and over the High Atlas Mountains via the Tizi- N-Tichka pass (2260m). We marvel at the gorgeous landscapes with a variety of colours and pass traditional Berber villages along the way. On route we stop to walk across a dried river to discover the UNESCO village hill fort of Ait Ben Haddou with its impressive Moroccan earthen clay buildings.\n\nWe arrive at Ouarzazate - known as a gateway to the Sahara where we spend the night in our hotel. Ouarzazate is a caramel coloured town that is simply breath taking and whose unique beauty has led to it being used as the filming location for Lawrence of Arabia, Gladiator, The Man Who Would Be King, The Living Daylights, The Mummy and many more.\n\nFriday - Dades Gorge and Merzouga Sahara desert\n\nWe continue to Skoura palm grove, then Valley of the Roses - the centre of Moroccan roses and rose products. Passing the Berber villages of the Dades Valley, we then arrive in Dades Gorge - carved out over centuries by the River Dades. We stop for a short visit along the 300m high canyons before continuing to Erg Chebbi dunes in Merzouga Sahara desert having lunch on the way, arriving in Erfoud. We enjoy a traditional cup of Berber mint tea before venturng on the camels for a trek amid the setting sun, witnessing how it melts into the horizon of the sand dunes. We enjoy dinner, Berber music and then spend an enchanting night in a nomadic tent under the shining stars in the depths of the Sahara desert.\n\nSaturday - Back to Marrakech\n\nAfter sunrise we ride by camel back to the vehicle and have the use of a hotel to shower before embarking on our journey back over the High Atlas mountains to Marrakech for our hotel stay and an evening to explore the vibrant city. The contrast between old and new is what makes Marrakech so appealing. Marrakech is buzzing and a must see city. Please note, the hotel in Marrakech is a basic but well located 2 star hotel, please don't expect Western Europe Hotel standards.\n\nSunday\n\nOur long weekend trip ends after breakfast. You can of course extend your stay - we recommend another night so that you can fully enjoy this amazing city.

        "description": "A picturesque adventure through England's most wooded county with a variety of attractions from historic buildings, picture postcard rural rivers and even a Witches cave. A glorious circular hike from the ancient market town of Farnham steeped in history going back nearly 1000 years on this trail through time. One of the very first Outdooraholics hikes from all those years ago, but still a timeless classic.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Explore the romantic and enchanting ruins of an abandoned abbey dating back nearly 1000 years\n\n• Visit the famous and picture postcard Tilford village cricket green\n\n• See an 800 year old oak tree\n\n• Visit a cave where supposedly a White Witch lived (Mother Ludlam)\n\n• Explore the Bourne Woods and see where Gladiator and over 20 other films were set\n\n• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey through woodland paths\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nStarting in the historic and attractive Georgian market town of Farnham, we go on a woodland valley trail via Mother Ludlam's cave (home to the White Witch of Waverley according to the legend), past Moor Park House, and then on to explore the site of Waverley Abbey ruins (founded 1128) and to see the grand Waverley Abbey House set on a lake. Our trail passes the famous cricket green at Tilford set in the delightful landscape of the River Wey and flanked by two medieval stone bridges and then onto the Bourne Woods.\n\nTilford Green is a superb example of a traditional village green from a long gone era - with a cricket pitch, pub and two medieval stone bridges. We then head on to visit an 800 year old oak tree (8 metre girth) before making our way back to Farnham. We also pass a farm where we see pigs (and often baby piglets). The Bourne woods has an interesting mix of heathland and coniferous trees and its beauty has drawn filmmakers for films such as Gladiator, Robin Hood, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Princess, War Horse and at least 20 others - we'll be hiking through the area where these were filmed.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Waterloo station at 8:35am leaving the meeting point at 8:50am for the 9am train.

We start our trail in the heart of rural Sussex on a route that takes in sleepy villages with thatched cottages and ancient time forgotten rural churches as we explore the Sussex Weald. We hike on ridge tops with breathtaking panoramic views and our trail leads us past an ancient hill carving and culminates on the coast!\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• See the mysterious Long Man of Wilmington hill carving, which is several hundred years old\n\n• Visit an ancient smugglers inn\n\n• Visit Eastbourne - the sunniest place in Britain, which conveniently happens to be on the coast\n\n• Hike the famous South Downs chalk hills\n\n• Explore rural Sussex and its picture postcard villages that time has forgotten\n\n• Enjoy a well deserved rest and a drink at a coastal town after the hike\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start off at Arlington Reservoir and we get an early glimpse of this ancient hillside figure known locally as the Long Man of Wilmington, which grows larger and larger until we're standing at its feet. Nobody knows the exact origins of the Long Man carving but it's believed to date from the 1500s or 1600s. Step by step we cross several hills that reward us with splendid panoramic views along much of our trail. As we get closer to the coast, we start sensing the alluring fresh scent of the sea air and coastal views.

        "description": "We venture to Kent again and this hike certainly illustrates why it's known as the \"Garden of England\". We visit the village of Otford which dates back over 3000 years and two other villages. A delightful rural hike which amongst other things takes us past two castles – Eynsford Castle and Lullingstone Castle and along a stretch of the River Darent.\n\nWe hike the Darent Valley Path alongside the River Darent and through the picturesque Kent fields and ancient wood. The area’s beauty attracted the Romans to settle here and in 80 AD Lullingstone Villa was constructed for a wealthy Roman who was keen on pagan worship.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Pass the magnificent Lullingstone Castle\n\n• Hike along a delightful stretch of the Darent Valley Path\n\n• Pass the site of the ruins of Lullingstone Roman Villa with its pagan history\n\n• Hike through the picturesque Lullingstone Country Park\n\n• Visit the remains Eynsford Castle\n\n• Explore 3 charming Kentish villages\n\n• Hike through the 22 metre high Eynsford Rail Viaduct with its nine red brick arches\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start from the picturesque village of Otford, occupied for at least 3000 years. Through the centuries Otford has been home to Iron Age farmers, Romans, Royalty and Archbishops. Our hike takes us through the tranquil woods and grasslands of the Kentish countryside reaching the quaint Shoreham town where the Darent Valley Path takes us to the magnificent Lullingstone Country Park. The park is internationally important due to its collection of ancient trees including beech, ash, oak, sweet chestnut and hornbeam some of which are believed to be 800 years old.\n\nWe reach Lullingstone Castle to admire its tranquil lake before we pass the historical Lullingstone Roman Villa - one of the few Roman estate survivals in Britain whose construction began in about 100 AD.\n\nFrom there, our hike continues among the rolling fields of Kent which reward with views towards the 9 arched Eynsford Rail Viaduct. Reaching the tranquil village of Eynsford, we explore the remains of Eynsford Castle - a medieval fortification built in 1088 and we finish our hike with a stroll along the lovely village.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:45am leaving the meeting point at 9am for the 9:14am train.

        "description": "We have a single room as an upgrade for a female, please email us at info@outdooraholics.co.uk\n\nThe Amalfi Coast is world renowned so we probably don’t need to tell you too much about this breathtaking rugged peninsula where a 1000m high mountainous landscape lush with vegetation and wildlife drops rapidly into the glimmering sea far below. Set in Southern Italy, this whole area is a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe Amalfi Coast is one of the most famous coastlines in Europe and offers some breathtaking walking including the “Path of the Gods” – considered one of the best hikes in the world.\n\nTrip Highlights:\n\n• Visit the world famous Mount Vesuvius volcano\n\n• Hike the famous \"Sentiero degli dei\" (Path of the Gods)\n\n• Visit the Roman site of Pompeii and explore this ancient town that has been preserved by volcanic ash for nearly 2000 years\n\n• Sample the famous Italian stone baked pizza and gelato\n\n• Stay in a friendly family owned guest house high in the hills and in twin bedded ensuite rooms. We also have our own private pool\n\n• Great guest house location with 3 of the hikes starting from the guest house door\n\n• Exclusive use of our guest house, just for our group so we can enjoy the place and relax\n\n• Free Day with option to self guided visit the gorgeous island of Capri and explore the remains of the Imperial villa of the Roman Emperor Tiberius or visit Ravello or enjoy the beach\n\n• Visit the chic and enchanting town of Positano – built into the mountain and nestling gently by the sea\n\n• Stunning waterfalls walk in the lush and dramatic Ferriere National Park\n\n• Explore the town of Amalfi – which gives its name to this UNESCO listed coastline\n\n• See the famous picture postcard Amalfi coastline from the sea on a boat trip\n\nPhotos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics\n\nVideo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6NLv3qbQSc\n\nClick here to join our Facebook community: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/\n\nHoliday Description\n\nWe’ve designed this holiday to show you the greatest walks that this area has to offer as well as some of its world famous sights. The Amalfi Coast is dotted with seaside towns rich in history and boasts a timeless beauty interspersed with a lively, Italian buzz and vibrancy. A place you can really explore nature one minute in the remote mountains and feel really alive in the crazy, Italian buzz by the sea a short while later. Our hikes take us along ancient paths and mule tracks where time has in places stood still. We’ve picked some great hikes that showcase this landscape and offer some awe inspiring views. We never quite escape the coastal views and the ever present sparkling turquoise sea below, reminding us just how high up these hikes are.\n\nThe Amalfi Coast is a very steep coastline where villages cling to steep rocky hillsides defying logic and almost gravity, with houses coloured in gentle pastel shades.\n\nThe Amalfi Coast is one of Western Europe’s premier tourist destinations and is not a cheap area to visit and although it would keep the cost lower to use a large impersonal package holiday style hotel with included dinners, we’ve decided against this and have found the most wonderful family owned accommodation in the mountains where 3 generations of this local family do a wonderful job of looking after us. We have all rooms booked just for our group, so no other guests staying too so we have the grounds and pool to ourselves and we're limiting this trip to just 22 members to make it really special.\n\nImportant\n\nThe hikes on this trip vary but some of them involve long descents which can be on steep ground and also some very rough and uneven ground walking on rocks and boulders for long sections. Although this trip is designed as a mixture of hiking with some sightseeing too, it is only suitable for fit and experienced hikers due to some tough and steep sections on parts of the hikes. An above average level of fitness is required and it’s definitely not for beginners. Some of the hikes are only 3 or 4 hours long. With twisty mountain roads, the buses may not be suitable for anyone who suffers travel sickness easily.\n\nHiking boots ideally with ankle protection are essential due to the rough, uneven and rocky terrain. Two of the hikes we will be walking over very rocky, uneven ground which may require the use of hands in places.\n\nITINERARY\n\nFriday 7th October\n\nThere will be a single fixed time complimentary transfer from the airport to our accommodation for those who are at the meeting point on time. We will then enjoy a relaxing evening meal and have time to get to meet each other in our wonderful rural mountainous surroundings. Our guest house is set outside the village a 10 to 15 minute walk away, so we escape the noise and stay in a more tranquil setting.\n\nSaturday 8th October\n\nSaturday's hike: Bomerano circular\nDistance: 6 miles (9km)\nAscent: Approx 500m ascent and 500m descent\nGrading: Intermediate (one tough uphill):\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\n\nToday we have a lovely circular hike from our guest house. We take in the summit of Monte Tre Calli (1122m high) from which we can get some great and far reaching views of the Peninsula as well as the mountain villages near where we are staying. A short but perfect hike to get to know the area and get our bearings.\n\nThere will be free time after the hike to explore the village of Bomerano and relax in the sun loungers by our private pool.\n\nSunday 9th October\n\nSunday's hike: Bomerano to Amalfi via Valle delle Ferriere Park\nDistance: 10 miles (16km)\nAscent: 840m\nDescent: 1400m\nGrading: Challenging with some rough and uneven tracks and narrow paths in places\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings\n\nAnother hike where we can just start from the guest house, we have some road walking at the start before departing into the dense wooded mountains on a breath taking trail that provides ever more tempting views of the lush wooded valleys and coastline that we will be exploring. With waterfalls, ancient ruins, mountain rivers and dreamy views this is quite a spectacular day of hiking. To finish it off we hike past scented lemon groves on a trail that delivers us to the coastal town of Amalfi which opens to the sea like a fan. We’ll have time to explore Amalfi’s historic streets and get some well deserved refreshments.\n\nMonday 10th October\n\nFREE DAY!!! Why not take the time to yourself to relax by the guest house pool, indulge in one of Bomerano’s numerous cafes or explore the surroundings? You can get buses from Bomerano to Amalfi and then onto most locations on the Amalfi Coast.\n\nOr you can visit Ravello - a small town considered to be one of the most romantic and beautiful places in southern Italy. Settled on steep terraced slopes high above sea level - this lovely town inspires with memorable coastal views and remains aloof from the madness of the coast below.\n\nShould you desire a more exotic experience - you can visit the island of Capri on a self guided tour. Capri is one of Italy’s most stunning islands – a favourite for Roman Emperors who built their villas here. It is also a tourist magnet attracting 2 million visitors a year.\n\nTrip to Capri and all of the self guided options today must be arranged individually but the tour guide can advise.\n\nTuesday 11th October\n\nDay trip to Vesuvius and Pompeii\n\nVesuvius is a world renowned volcano that dramatically brought an end to the Roman towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum and a few others in its great eruption of 79AD. Its fertile soil helps provide some of the great tasting local tomatoes and grapes (sure we’ll experience these in the wines!)\n\nPompeii is an experience to visit, the ruins being mesmerising, fascinating and quite poignant. It’s surprisingly well preserved for a 2000 year old town, a true time capsule from the days when the Roman Empire ruled much of the world and can really feel like walking around a Roman town. Pompeii offers a fascinating glimpse into the everyday life of the ancient Roman world including the remains of bakeries, brothels, baths and numerous cobbled streets. You can explore this site either by yourself or if you prefer you can opt for one of the local guides who are usually available at the entrance (variable rates - payable direct to the guide).\n\nYou will need to pay the entry to these attractions locally (approx 11 to 16 Euros each plus another 10 Euros at Pompeii for a guided tour, if you choose).\n\nWe have also arranged a private licensed transfer by coach with a professional driver who will be with us for the day.\n\nWednesday 12th October\n\nWednesday's hike: The famous \"Sentiero degli dei\" (Path of the Gods)\nDistance: 4 miles (6km) (option to lengthen)\nAscent: 350m\nGrading: Beginners/Intermediate, rocky in places:\n\nWe’re saving this epic hike until our last full day. We hike a winding trail that delicately hugs the rugged mountains as it follows their twists and turns. We get the most dramatic and lofty views of the trip as for much of the hike we can look down to the sea far below. We pass ancient houses, vineyards, woodland and a goat farm or two.\n\nWe finish in Positano – considered to be the most picturesque and photogenic town on the coastline. Steeply stacked houses literally tumble down the mountain towards the sea dotted with the most diverse range of pastel colours creating quite a captivating setting. We explore the town losing ourselves in a maze of alleys, a visit to the beach and no doubt a good café too are on the cards. You can also explore some very chic boutique shops. We then take a boat trip to Amalfi and return to our guest house.\n\nThursday 13th October\n\nThe trip ends after breakfast. You may wish to stay on for a few days to explore the area further or perhaps visit Rome (which has an airport with flights back to London) for a few days on the high speed train from Naples which whisks you away in just 1 hour 8 minutes at 300kmph. This is merely an idea for when the trip has ended, you would need to arrange all details yourself if you choose to stay on. Usually about 1/3 of the group choose to stay on.\n\nDiscussion forum for this trip: https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53515485/\n\nCost and Payment\n\nThe trip is £743 per person.

We have decided against eating at the guest house every night so that we’re not tied to the same place and we can get a great range of Italian food at a variety of different restaurants and cafés. A typical dinner can be had in most places for approximately 10-25 Euros excluding drinks.\n\nMost restaurants cater for vegetarians but will be a more limited choice. However, in a country where the diet is mainly pasta, bread and pizza, we could not locate any gluten free products on our previous trip except gluten free bread, so if you are gluten free your best bet is naturally gluten free products like salads, fruit and veg making for a very limited dietary choice.\n\nThe price includes:\n\n• 6 nights accommodation in a family run, rural guest house sharing ensuite single gender twin bedrooms, the guest house has WIFI - in the mountains this can be an intermittent service.\n\n• Breakfast each day\n\n• 4 packed lunches\n\n• Hikes by an experienced and trained Hike Leader with an Outdoor First Aid qualification\n\n• Compliance with the 2018 Package Travel Regulations including Financial protection\n\n• Complimentary airport transfer at the start and end of the trip.

        "description": "This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.\n\nThe Yorkshire Dales include some of the best limestone landscapes in England and this hike is consistently voted one of the top hikes in England. Malham is indeed a special and unusual place to visit - a large part of it being designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. This Malham Dale journey includes all the highlights of Malhalm’s limestone scenery (formed 300 million years ago), broadleaved woodland and two stunning waterfalls, pretty streams, long dry stone walls and hay meadows, farming landscapes and a breath taking gorge - Gordale Scar.\n\nThe special beauty of the Malham area has attracted many producers and filmmakers including a scene from Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows filmed here in 2009.\n\nThis is a moderate and medium length hike with only a small scramble part up next to the waterfall at the end of Gordale Scar. The scramble will require the use of your hands\n\n**Trip highlights:**\n\n• Approx 12 to 14 attendees\n• Hike in the Yorkshire Dales National Park - voted by Trip Advisor in 2021 the best National Park in Europe\n• Enjoy the immense beauty and dramatic limestone scenery of the Malham area\n• Hike through the “backbone of Britain” - the iconic Pennine way, the first and the oldest of the 11 National Trails in England\n• Admire the remarkable curving limestone amphitheatre - Malham Cove with a large area of limestone pavement on the top\n• Enjoy the splendid gorge twisting between limestone cliffs more than 100m high - Gordale Scar that was inspiration for many famous romantic painters (as James M. W. Turner and James Ward) whose works can be seen in Tate Britain today\n• Admire the gorgeous Janet’s Foss waterfall\n• Visit the highest lake in the country and one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe - the Malham Tarn\n• Build your own weekend trip around this day\n\n**Hike description:**\n\nThe hike starts from the small but most popular village in the Yorkshire Dales - Malham. The route follows The Pennine Way through a delightful wooded area (Wedber Wood) to our first stop - the Janet's Foss waterfall set in its own little amphitheatre. This small and pretty waterfall flows into a crystal clear pool which was used as a natural sheep dip for local farmers in the past. Foss is a Nordic word for waterfall, still used in Scandinavia. According to a legend, the waterfall was named after a Fairy Queen called Janet who is believed to have inhabited a cave behind the fall.\n\nOne of the most spectacular natural sights in the country is on our way next - the Gordale Scar. This gorge was created during the Ice Age. At first melted water created a cave that eventually collapsed and created the waterfall and the gorge we see today. Because of its impressive size, it becomes visible once we hike through the Gordale Campsite opening up a picturesque and magnificent landscape in front of our eyes.\nThe path finishes into a rocky floor flanked by steep Limestone cliffs - over 100 metres in height. A steep scramble up the waterfall is awaiting us here.\nThe scar itself has been the subject of an 1818 sonnet “Gordale” by William Wordsworth: \"let thy feet repair to Gordale chasm, terrific as the lair where the young lions couch\".\n\nDepending on conditions there are a couple of route options but we eventually get to the stunning Malham Tarn. With an altitude of 377m, it is England’s highest freshwater lake, its karstic origin dates back to the Carboniferous ages. The lake is a Special Area of Conservation, as well as a National Nature Reserve for wildlife owned by the National Trust.\n\nThen we start heading back down an ancient dry valley to suddenly come out at the top of Malham Cove. The 80 metre limestone cliff formation and the emblematic Limestone pavements above are breathtaking with the view over the valley. These pavements provide unique wildlife habitats and micro-climates for rare wild flowers and ferns. Peregrine falcons live in these mountains and lunatic climbers can be spotted.\nThis is where Harry and Hermione set up camp in a tent on the Limestone Pavement at the top of Malham Cove from the “The Deathly Hallows” and “Harry Potter” movies.\n\nAfter our last destination we descend down and return back to the village.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet outside The Buck Inn in Malham, North Yorkshire at 8:45am. Postcode: BD23 4DA. Please make sure to arrive on time. Planned start time is 9am with estimated returning time of 5 to 6pm.\n\nClick here for a map location of our meeting point: [LINK](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Buck+Inn/@54.0610077,-2.1529041,18.08z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x0:0xa125033b864635de!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d54.0610115!4d-2.1530291)\n\nYou will need transport to and from the start of this hike, which is outside London.

        "description": "Join us and visit the desert of dreams - an exhilarating place everyone should see once! We all know the Sahara from films - vast, awe inspiring and desolate with a natural and pure beauty. Roughly the size of the United States and 4800km long, it is the largest hot desert in the world. Whilst it conjures up images of camels trekking across the sun baked sand dunes, there is so much more to the desert and this area than just sand and camels! We visit a breath taking fortified village, stay in Ouarzazate, visit the Dades Gorge, camp under the stars after watching the sun set whilst listening to Berber music, take a road trip on a mountain pass over the High Atlas mountains and finish our trip in Marrakesh to experience this vibrant and buzzing capital city.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Spend a night in the desert under the stars\n\n• Trek through the desert Bedouin style on a camel\n\n• Enjoy a night in Marrakech to savour the buzzing capital city\n\n• Pass over the High Atlas Mountains via Tizi- N-Tichka pass (2260m)\n\n• Visit the UNESCO World Heritage site of Ait Ben Haddou - a historic fortified village\n\n• Local English speaking guide\n\n• Pass through the Valley of the roses\n\n• Trek from Tamnalt Hills (Hill of Human Bodies) to Dades gorge, and marvel at the ancient rock creations\n\n• Small group trip limited to just 12\n\n**Important Notes**\n\nDriving - please note, due to the remoteness of the Sahara desert there is a lot of driving both to get there and also back.\n\n**ITINERARY**\n\nThu - drive from Marrakesh to Ouarzazate\n\nLeave from Marrakech early and drive towards Ouarzazate, pass through the famous Valley of the Roses and over the High Atlas Mountains via the Tizi- N-Tichka pass (2260m). We marvel at the gorgeous landscapes with a variety of colours and pass traditional Berber villages along the way. On route we stop to walk across a dried river to discover the UNESCO village hill fort of Ait Ben Haddou with its impressive Moroccan earthen clay buildings.\n\nWe arrive at Ouarzazate - known as a gateway to the Sahara where we spend the night in our hotel. Ouarzazate is a caramel coloured town that is simply breath taking and whose unique beauty has led to it being used as the filming location for Lawrence of Arabia, Gladiator, The Man Who Would Be King, The Living Daylights, The Mummy and many more.\n\nFri - Dades Gorge and Merzouga Sahara desert\n\nWe continue to Skoura palm grove, then Valley of the Roses - the centre of Moroccan roses and rose products. Passing the Berber villages of the Dades Valley, we then arrive in Dades Gorge - carved out over centuries by the River Dades. We stop for a short visit along the 300m high canyons before continuing to Erg Chebbi dunes in Merzouga Sahara desert having lunch on the way, arriving in Erfoud. We enjoy a traditional cup of Berber mint tea before venturng on the camels for a trek amid the setting sun, witnessing how it melts into the horizon of the sand dunes. We enjoy dinner, Berber music and then spend an enchanting night in a nomadic tent under the shining stars in the depths of the Sahara desert.\n\nSat - Back to Marrakech\n\nAfter sunrise we ride by camel back to the vehicle and have the use of a hotel to shower before embarking on our journey back over the High Atlas mountains to Marrakech for our hotel stay and an evening to explore the vibrant city. The contrast between old and new is what makes Marrakech so appealing. Marrakech is buzzing and a must see city. Please note, the hotel in Marrakech is a basic but well located 2 star hotel, please don't expect Western Europe Hotel standards.\n\nSun\n\nOur long weekend trip ends after breakfast. You can of course extend your stay - we recommend another night so that you can fully enjoy this amazing city. Alternatively it works well to come out to the trip early, have time in Marrakech and then meet the group at the airport at the start of the trip refreshed and already introduced to Morocco.\n\nDiscussion forum - [LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53626096/)\n\n**Cost & Payment**\n\nThe trip is £358 per person.

        "description": "This hike takes us across the South Downs on a superb route, but it's tough and long and a brisk pace. It is a route we have devised ourselves and is a gem. You follow the hills, valleys and rivers of the South Downs on this hiking challenge which ends with gorgeous views of the Seven Sisters by the sea (please note, we do not hike the Seven Sisters). For much of the day you're high up in the sky on the South Downs hills and ridges, with far reaching views, but this hike is also very exposed to the weather and often windy.\n\nThis is one of our two toughest day hikes from London and is only for very experienced hikers, ideally who have done our Seven Sisters hike and found it easy. It's got quite a few long and steep hills and is about 50% longer than the Seven Sisters hike plus it's a brisk/fast pace.\n\n**Trip Highlights**\n\n• Hiking high up on the South Downs ridges with some spectacular views\n\n• Hike part of the famous South Downs Way\n\n• Distant coastal views including the Seven Sisters cliffs\n\n• Hike through dramatic Glacial “dry valleys”\n\n• We will finish at Seaford on the beach\n\n• A great physical challenge, for the fit and fast hikers who find Seven Sisters easy\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start off in the historic town of Lewes which is a well preserved Sussex market town dating back to the 6th century. We're soon out on our rural trail that leads us into the rich tapestry of green landscapes, tranquility and breathtaking views of the area. Crossing the river Ouse and it’s beautiful valley, we make headway into the South Downs, going further into Britain’s newest National Park. Along our hike over several hills and summits, we pass by the picturesque area of floodplains where the Cuckmere River pours into the English Channel, forming a beach estuary steeped in history.\n\nOur trail rewards us with a good few reminders of how close to the sea we are here with good views of the Channel on a clear day and to stretch our eyes as far as the legendary Seven Sisters coastal cliffs. We finish in the coastal town of Seaford which is home to a Martello Tower from 1810 which formed part of a string of 103 towers to defend against French invasion in Napoleonic times.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at London Bridge station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:45am train.

        "description": "When you think of Surrey the first thing that comes to mind is cosy little villages, gentle green pastures and secluded country houses. While the first part of this hike very much meets this expectation, you'd be surprised to find out how wild and unexplored the vast woodlands and heather-covered moors of Surrey can be.\n\nThis walk reveals lush countryside as well as bright and open woodlands and stunning views from some of the hills. This is a picturesque adventure across England's most wooded county with a variety of attractions from historic buildings, postcard-worthy rural rivers and an ancient market town steeped in history. It ends at the start of the famous North Downs Way\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Explore the beautiful Surrey countryside Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\n• Hike along part of the North Downs Way - the 2nd most acclaimed long distance route in South East England\n\n• Idyllic hiking along the banks of the River Wey\n\n• Visit Guildford - Surrey's most significant ancient town with Bronze Age roots\n\n• Marvel at the ancient ruins of St Catherine's church, built by giants according to legend\n\n• Explore the magic of Puttenham Common woodlands which grow on a sandy landscape\n\n• Take a spectacular panorama photo from atop the Crooksbury Hill\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nGuildford is best known for being a picturesque and quaint market town near London, but the countryside has far more to offer than most visitors discover beyond the cobbled streets and historical buildings.\n\nFrom Guildford we hike along the picturesque River Wey canal where the nestled boat houses sit on this tranquil waterway leading us to the ruin of St Catherine's church, dating back to the 14th century and steeped in legend. William Turner came to paint St Catherine's Church in the early 18th century and his paintings now hang in the Tate Gallery.\n\nWe then join the ancient North Downs Way path passing several farms and enjoying the medieval Loseley House along the way, a very old Tudor manor house whose estate appears in the Doomsday book of 1086 as Losele when it was owned by Roger Montgomery, a senior Aide of William the Conqueror. We reach the edge of Puttenham Common, where large swathes of beautiful blooming bell heather and ling dominate the open areas, with areas of oak and Scots pine. We then come out into Puttenham, a very pretty village with a large mansion that was home to a world famous rockstar - Roger Taylow from Queen.\n\nCrooksbury Hill is our next stop along the way, a wooded hilltop with breathtaking views over southwest Surrey and east Hampshire, across to the South Downs. The view is gorgeous and you'll feel like you're a million miles away from London.\n\nThe hike ends at the historic and attractive market town of Farnham, dating back to the Stone Age. We enjoy the fine examples of Georgian architecture before heading back home.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Waterloo station at 8:25am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 9am train. Please arrive on time as we cannot wait for anyone who is late.\n\nWe meet under the main central clock.

        "description": "The latest in our series of new hikes, this is based on the old Devils Dyke hike we did in 2013, but a much improved route finishing at Shoreham on Sea.\n\nOur trail takes us across the South Downs along elevated tracks with superb far reaching views and both into and across chalk valleys. It’s quite a varied route with sections of woodland and for much of the time we will be high up on the South Downs Hills offering far reaching views. On our route the sea slowly gets closer until we finally hit the beach at the coastal town of Shoreham by Sea.\n\nAlong our trail we visit the remains of the ancient Wolstonbury Hill Fort hill fort dating back around 3000 years to the Bronze Age - the Late Neolithic period.\n\nPlease note, this hike is hilly hence the Tough rating, the ascent is approx 600/650m which is almost as much as some of our mountain hiking days.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Hike in the South Downs - one of the best National Parks in the South of England\n• Visit the remains of a Bronze Age hill fort\n• Hike along the ancient Devil's Dyke valley\n• Enjoy stunning coastal views as we approach our destination by the sea\n• Explore the adorable historical town and beach of Shoreham on Sea\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start at Hassocks and our adventure takes us up onto the South Downs ridge, traversing part of the South Downs National Park, Britain's newest National Park. A 3000 year old route takes us along the top of the chalk highlands and passes by Wolstonbury Hill, a good location for wild orchid spotting with views almost as far as London. Our trail continues further along the chalk ridges of the famous South Downs Way with superb views both inland and to the sea. We then reach the Devil's Dyke, a deep valley surrounded by steep hills - one of the best view points of the South Downs where we can see The Sussex Weald and on a clear day, the Isle of Wight. It is the site of an Iron Age hillfort, and a pub. The view is so gorgeous, that a tourist railway and station was once built here just for day trippers to admire the view\n\nOur next stop is Fulking Hill, an area of bowl barrows containing archaeological remains and environmental evidence relating to the way the monument was constructed and used in the Late Neolithic and the Bronze Age. We enjoy more views from the top of the slope at Truleigh Hill, picked out by its distinctive masts, with the crown of trees on Chanctonbury Ring further on.\n\nThe South Downs reward us with yet more fantastic and far reaching panoramas as we approach the sea on our way past the tiny Shoreham airport - the oldest commercial airport in the world with a protected 1936 art deco terminal building that plays host to many films including \"The Da Vinci Code\", Agatha Christie's \"Poirot\" and \"Woman in Gold\". We finish our hike in the historic fishing town of Shoreham on Sea for a well earned drink and rest.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Victoria station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:45am train.

We also cross lush river valleys in one of our most spectacular and dramatic day hikes. Much of this landscape was formed by glaciers in the last ice age.\n\nWe'll get superb far reaching panoramic views as far as the sea from the elevated ridges we hike on for much of the day and also the chance to hike along the unique white chalk paths of the South Downs National Park. After the hike we'll return back to the attractive and ancient market town of Lewes.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Spectacular elevated hike on the high ridges of the South Downs\n\n• Distant coastal views including of the Seven Sisters cliffs\n\n• Visit a 2500 year old Iron Age Hill Fort\n\n• Cross the Greenwich Meridian line separating the Eastern and Western Hemispheres\n\n• Hike through dramatic Glacial “dry valleys”\n\n• Hike part of the famous South Downs Way\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe'll start off in the historic town of Lewes which is a well preserved Sussex market town dating back to the 6th century.

Crossing the river Ouse and its beautiful valley, we make headway into the South Downs, going further into Britain’s newest National Park. Along our hike over several hills and summits, we visit Mount Caburn which was the site of an Iron Age hill fort dating back to 400 BC along with 140 burial pits with a few ditches still remaining. We also pass by the village of Rodmell where Virginia Woolf lived nearby in Monk's House and we cross the footbridge of River Ouse, where her lifetime story ended abruptly.\n\nThe chalk composition and heavy sheep grazing in the area results in a relatively barren and stark landscape in places which has its own unique beauty. We join part of the famous South Down Way which is the first bridleway National Trail. Our trail rewards us with a good few reminders of how near to the coast we are here with good views of the Channel on a clear day and to stretch our eyes as far as the legendary Seven Sisters coastal cliffs.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at London Bridge station at 8:15am leaving the meeting point at 8:30am for the 8:45am train.

        "description": "Come and join us for this hike that takes us on a trail through both Sussex and Kent as we explore two counties. We pass the ancient rock formations of Harrison’s Rocks which owe their dramatic and striking shape to the last ice age. As we wander around below the crag surrounded by a lush woodland we’ll admire the majestic beauty of the sandstone formations. Our hike then continues across the border into the beautiful scenery of Kent - the Garden of England. On our way we will explore historical manors with enchanted forests, follow lazy, meandering rivers and indulge our senses with lush countryside.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Visit the famous Harrison’s Rocks formed over 135 million years ago and shaped by the last Ice Age\n\n• Explore two beautiful counties in one day - Kent and Sussex\n\n• Pass a famous manor house dated back to the 1200s\n\n• See the majestic Harrison Rocks which are a Site of Special Scientific Interest\n\n• Be surrounded by a variety of wildlife species including rare plants\n\n**Hike Description**\n\nWe start off in the idyllic village of Eridge, nestled in the northern borderlands of East Sussex next to Kent. Following the picturesque views across the Kent and Sussex countryside. Our trail reveals and abundance of lush countryside demonstrating why Kent is known as the Garden of England, bright and open woodlands including Broadwater forest are home to abundant wildlife. We’ll then hike to the impressive Harrison’s rocks - a collection of rock outcrops that date back about 135 million years but that owe their dramatic and striking shapes to the last Ice Age. They're extremely popular with climbers who we're likely to see.\n\nOur delightful rural hike continues on to the truly stunning Kentish scenery. Much of this section goes through very peaceful countryside with a remote feeling. We pass the well-known moated manor of Groombridge which has a rich history of over 700 years. The manor house as well as the bridges and moat gates were largely designed by Sir Christopher Wren, known for his redesign of St Paul’s Cathedral, following the Great Fire of London in 1666. From here we will dive into serene shady woods of Kent where we can quiet our minds and enjoy the scenic beauty of the countryside. Our hike finishes back to Eridge where we will have a well-deserved rest and drinks before we head home.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at London Bridge station at 8:40am leaving the meeting point at 8:55am for the 9:07am train.

We hike through beech woodland, chalk uplands and get some great views over the vale of Aldbury before leading back through the woods of the Ashridge Estate - the former home of the Dukes of Bridgewater. We then drop into the quaint and unspoilt village of Aldbury. Part of our route takes us along the ancient path of the famous Ridgeway Trail, a 5000 year old trading route, described as Britain's oldest road and we also pass the Bridgewater Monument - created to honour the Duke who built one of Britain's first canals.\n\nIvinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree meant that it was a favoured location for many dramas such as \"The Avengers\" and \"The Saint\".\n\nFor the attentive and sharp eyed a 483 foot long white lion carved into a distant chalk hill is also visible from the stunning panorama of Ivinghoe Beacon.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet at Euston station at 8:30am leaving the meeting point at 8:45am for the 8:55am train.

        "description": "This one to the central Brecon Beacons provides both the best hiking and takes the most popular and truly spectacular walks in this National Park.\n\nOur trip leader Graham knows his area very well having spent 4 years living close by and he's done the main hike on this trip over 39 times and been coming here for 25 years. Probably our most copied weekend trip and with good reason!\n\nOn Friday when it's quieter we'll hike the mountains that surround the Neuadd reservoir including Pen Y Fan - the highest and most popular mountain in South Wales with far reaching views over the Severn Estuary. On Saturday we’ll take in a less tough waterfall walk where we will walk behind a huge waterfall. On Sunday we enjoy an equally beautiful but very different again hike near the hostel.\n\nThe hostel itself is a real gem – a converted farmhouse high in the Brecons hills, nestling in a picturesque and isolated location just by the reservoir. We have a log burner to enjoy in the evenings and a very cosy building as our base. 10 bedrooms with 10 bathrooms, it's almost all ensuite\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n• 3 gorgeous and contrasting hikes in the Brecon Beacons National Park\n\n• Stay in a lovely converted farmhouse high in the mountains and in a stunning rural setting\n\n• A nearly fully catered trip - we get to eat out one night to sample the local cuisine\n\n• Hike the iconic Brecons Horseshoe\n\n• Enjoy gorgeous scenery passing through 4 stunning waterfalls\n\n**Weekend Description**\n\nThe Horseshoe walk is the most popular in the Brecon Beacons and it's easy to see why with staggering panoramic views. Having hiked the entire National Park extensively, it's the guide's personal favourite. It's fairly tough but offers breath-taking views over the flat land to the North and back into the Brecon Beacons mountain range and on a clear day you can even see the sea and Gower Peninsula.\n\nThe waterfalls walk is a less tough walk for Saturday and passes 4 substantial waterfalls, one of which we can actually walk behind. With a huge torrent of water rushing past and the noise and spray, it's a pretty exhilarating experience by itself. There is some gorgeous scenery and superb photo opportunities as we follow the winding trail of the river and we'll also visit the largest cave opening in South Wales where we can walk inside.\n\nOn Sunday we take in the smaller peak of Tor Y Foel which offers fine views of the surrounding area, being a very isolated peak. We’ll then follow the Brecon and Monmouthshire canal (which has been restored and is now navigable) into the village of Talybont and then back to the hostel following the route of a tramway hundreds of years old\n\n**Itinerary**\n\nThursday\n\nHead over to the hostel which we have hired exclusively for our group. On arrival we can light the log burner and enjoy the comfort of the sitting room and get to know others on the trip.\n\nFriday\n\nHike: The Brecon Horseshoe\nDistance: 9 miles (14km)\nGrading: [Challenging - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings), one steep climb at the start, we are summitting 3 mountain peaks\nAscent: Approx 600m\n\nThe walk takes in the highest mountain in South Wales - Pen Y Fan (886m) as well as the mountain peaks of Corn Du and Cribyn. It’s a dramatic, raw and rugged landscape dotted with occasional reservoirs and set above valleys and rivers, made even more exhilarating by the ridge top walks and far stretching views.\n\nSaturday\n\nHike: The waterfalls of the Afon Mellte river\nDistance: 6 miles (9km)\nGrading: [Intermediate - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings)**,** with rough stony ground in places and steep sections, it can be slippery\nAscent: 270m\n\nWe’ll follow the Afon Mellte river through a deep and rich woodland valley passing four waterfalls on the way. The area has very lush vegetation and has been designated a site of special scientific interest. We'll get to actually walk behind a waterfall too as well as venture into the mouth of the largest cave opening in South Wales.\n\nSunday\n\nHike: Tor Y Foel and the Monmouthsire and Brecon canal\nDistance: 7.5 to 9 miles (12km to 15km)\nGrading: [Intermediate - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings) \\- one hill\nAscent: Approx 200 to 300m\n\nWe'll hike to the peak of Tor Y Foel which offers superb views of the surrounding area before following a gorgeous and picture postcard trail along the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal (dating from 1796) that takes us to the village of Talybont before returning to the hostel along a 200 year old tramway route\n\n**Cost & Payment**\n\nThe trip is £221 per person.

        "description": "This trip is outside London and you will need transport to and from the destination - please check the Transport and Meeting point section below.\n\nThe magnificence of the Peak District National Park lies in its two contrasting personalities - the soft landscapes of the White Peak to the South and the wild and wonderful ruggedness of the Dark Peak to the North.\n\nWe’re off to the stunning desolate Northern part where we’ll explore one of the few places of true wilderness in England - Bleaklow Mountain. Dive into the true sense of remoteness of the Dark Peak and discover stunning landscapes soaked in mystery.

Popping out on the plateau, our path continues towards James' Thorn and the remains of a Lancaster Bomber - one of the first post WW2 plane crashes. From there we head towards Higher Shelf Stones to see the most famous wreck - the B29 Superfortress - USAF Boeing on a flight from Scampton to Burtonwood when it crashed in 1948. There is a significant amount of this wreckage left including a wing, fuselage and all 4 giant engines with 18 cylinders each!\n\nLeaving the memories of a by-gone era behind, we head to the top of Bleaklow Mountain, which offers far reaching views towards Snowdon, Liverpool and the Yorkshire 3 Peaks, a lot of counties and even Snowdonia. It's no exaggeration to say you can see much of central England from this hill and even the sea past Liverpool.\n\nWe descend and return to Glossop down past the Kissing Stones, Lightside and past Dog Rock with impressive views down into Dowstone Clough and back to the bright lights of Glossop.\n\n**Transport & Meeting Point**\n\nWe meet outside the Glossop Train Station building on Norfolk Street, Glossop at the small car parking area in front of it at 9:45am and leave at 10:00am prompt - please buy a parking ticket to cover all day.

        "description": "We have an upgrade available for two people coming together to a private two person room, for details please email us at info@outdooraholics.co.uk\n\nWe can offer lifts, please email us.\n\nThe weather is not normally so great for hiking at New Years, so what better than to go to England's sunniest island - with it's own micro climate averaging nearly 5 hours a day of sunshine. Also, this is an easy drive from London of just about 1.5 hours with a ferry journey - an ideal short drive for a trip where we are likely to have a drink or two ;-)\n\nThis trip really is quite special - we've booked an Edwardian era hostel exclusively hired for our group a short walk from the gorgeous Totland Bay. A perfect setting for a New Years break and party, a chance to spend time with like minded people. The better weather and the beauty of this island have attracted people since Roman times and even led Britain's longest ruling Monarch Queen Victoria to have her home Osborne House built here where she lived for over half a century.\n\nCome and let us show you this great island as we hike the best and most spectacular trails it has to offer with stunning panoramic sea views over the chalk cliffs. Please note - although we have 3 fantastic hikes, this trip will be less formal than our usual trips and less organised and there will be a lot of emphasis on New Years fun and celebrations to see in the New Year, festivity and partying likely to go on into the late night and possibly early morning. Please only sign up if this appeals to you. This will also be a larger group trip of about 55/60 people.\n\nTrip Highlights:\n\n• Explore England's largest island\n\n• Experience the milder sub climate and the islands average of 5 hours a day of sun\n\n• Hike the white cliffs and see the sweeping panoramic views from Tennyson Down\n\n• See the famous Needles - dramatic chalk stacks sticking out of the sea\n\n• Explore the striking and unusual multi coloured cliffs at Alum Bay\n\n• Selection of stunning and unspoilt coastlines\n\n• Find out why this walking paradise has over 500 miles of footpaths and is home to England's largest walking festival!\n\n• 2 to 3 hike leaders each day giving the opportunity to split into smaller groups\n\nPhotos - All photos were taken by Outdooraholics on previous trips so are the actual views that you will see from the route that you'll be hiking (except the Lighthouse - included with permission)\n\nVideo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdSggnHRTIU\n\nClick here to join our Facebook community:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/Outdooraholics/\n\nWeekend Description\n\nThe Isle of Wight really is a gem - a small island but with 60 miles of undulating and varied coastline that was separated from mainland Britain 7000 years ago and now sits across 5 miles of sea. After our journey over the sea by ferry we'll start exploring this island.\n\nThe island has some unique geology - it's small, but has a chalk ridge running through it like a spine offering unique views of both the sea and the pure white glistening cliffs that drop off to the sea. There are also greensands, clays, limestone and sandstone under foot which leads to a great variety of plants and wildlife. Being cut off from the mainland it's one of the few places in Britain where Red Squirrels have survived and the warmer climate is great for a variety of wild life - like the 43 species of butterflies that live on the island.\n\nWe're hiring a hostel exclusively for our group on the quieter Western side of the island, the stunning beauty of which has led to it being officially designated an \"Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\" and we have spectacular hike straight from the hostel. With its great variety of fauna and flora, spacious downs, secluded beaches and picturesque villages it's come to be known as the Garden Isle.\n\nThe name \"Dinosaur Isle\" has been often attributed to the Isle of Wight as well as over 20 species of dinosaur have been recognised and complete skeletons found. Other historical interests include over 240 burial mounds from the Bronze Age which have been identified on the chalk downs.\n\nNotably falling under the Isle of Wight's spell were Queen Victoria and Prince Albert who built and occupied Osborne House near Cowes for over half a century until her death in 1901 and the Poet Lord Tennyson who lived here too.\n\nITINERARY\n\nFriday 30th December\n\nEscape London and enjoy a car ferry trip over to the island. Relax in our exclusively hired Edwardian hostel at Totland Bay and have some time for drinks and to getting to know people. We'll meet from 7pm so you have time to enjoy the evening and get to know people on the trip.\n\nSaturday 31st December\n\nSaturday's hike: The Needles and Tennyson Down circular\nDistance: 14 miles (22km)\nAscent: 366m\nGrading: Intermediate. Long but less hilly than most of our hikes but due to the distance this will be done at a moderate to brisk pace - click here for details (https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings/)\n\nThis hike takes in what are undisputedly the best views on the island. We'll be hiking over an elevated chalk ridge with striking views on either side of the chalk cliffs that disappear and give way to the sea. These culminate in the breath taking Needles. It will then feel like we're just hiking towards the next spectacular view as we head along Tennyson Down towards Freshwater Bay and continue on a fantastic circular route taking in woodland, a Nature Reserve, the coastal port town of Yarmouth and then back to our hostel mid to late afternoon with time to shower and smarten up before our dinner and big evening celebrations begin!\n\nSunday 1st January\n\nSunday's hike: St Catherine's Lighthouse and coast\nDistance: 9-11 miles (15-18km)\n\nWe will welcome the New Year with a later than usual start today for a shorter hike that is kinder to hikers who have been up late celebrating last night. We'll be back in time for a well deserved drink and dinner.\n\nMonday 2nd January\n\nMonday's hike: Compton Down and the Chines\nDistance: 8.5 miles (14km)\nAscent: 288m\nGrading: Intermediate. Two main hills, less hilly than most of our usual hikes - click here for details (https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings/)\n\nWe'll be going over the dramatic chalk ridge of Compton Down which offers some great panoramic views of the island. Our route will also take in another section of the coastal path high up on the cliffs before we head inland to explore some of the woods and heathland of the island. We are due to finish in Freshwater bay at around 2:30pm to 3:30pm which will be the end of the trip.\n\nCost and Payment\n\nThe trip is £256 per person.\n\nTo join us please RSVP Yes and pay the £30 deposit by PayPal with the remainder due by bank transfer before Sunday 25th September.

        "description": "Join us and visit the desert of dreams - an exhilarating place everyone should see once! We all know the Sahara from films - vast, awe inspiring and desolate with a natural and pure beauty. Roughly the size of the United States and 4800km long, it is the largest hot desert in the world. Whilst it conjures up images of camels trekking across the sun baked sand dunes, there is so much more to the desert and this area than just sand and camels! We visit a breath taking fortified village, stay in Ouarzazate, visit the Dades Gorge, camp under the stars after watching the sun set whilst listening to Berber music, take a road trip on a mountain pass over the High Atlas mountains and finish our trip in Marrakesh to experience this vibrant and buzzing capital city.\n\n**Trip Highlights:**\n\n• Spend a night in the desert under the stars\n\n• Trek through the desert Bedouin style on a camel\n\n• Enjoy a night in Marrakech to savour the buzzing capital city\n\n• Pass over the High Atlas Mountains via Tizi- N-Tichka pass (2260m)\n\n• Visit the UNESCO World Heritage site of Ait Ben Haddou - a historic fortified village\n\n• Local English speaking guide\n\n• Pass through the Valley of the roses\n\n• Trek from Tamnalt Hills (Hill of Human Bodies) to Dades gorge, and marvel at the ancient rock creations\n\n• Small group trip limited to just 12\n\n**Important Notes**\n\nDriving - please note, due to the remoteness of the Sahara desert there is a lot of driving both to get there and also back.\n\n**ITINERARY**\n\nThursday - drive from Marrakesh to Ouarzazate\n\nLeave from Marrakech early and drive towards Ouarzazate, pass through the famous Valley of the Roses and over the High Atlas Mountains via the Tizi- N-Tichka pass (2260m). We marvel at the gorgeous landscapes with a variety of colours and pass traditional Berber villages along the way. On route we stop to walk across a dried river to discover the UNESCO village hill fort of Ait Ben Haddou with its impressive Moroccan earthen clay buildings.\n\nWe arrive at Ouarzazate - known as a gateway to the Sahara where we spend the night in our hotel. Ouarzazate is a caramel coloured town that is simply breath taking and whose unique beauty has led to it being used as the filming location for Lawrence of Arabia, Gladiator, The Man Who Would Be King, The Living Daylights, The Mummy and many more.\n\nFriday - Dades Gorge and Merzouga Sahara desert\n\nWe continue to Skoura palm grove, then Valley of the Roses - the centre of Moroccan roses and rose products. Passing the Berber villages of the Dades Valley, we then arrive in Dades Gorge - carved out over centuries by the River Dades. We stop for a short visit along the 300m high canyons before continuing to Erg Chebbi dunes in Merzouga Sahara desert having lunch on the way, arriving in Erfoud. We enjoy a traditional cup of Berber mint tea before venturng on the camels for a trek amid the setting sun, witnessing how it melts into the horizon of the sand dunes. We enjoy dinner, Berber music and then spend an enchanting night in a nomadic tent under the shining stars in the depths of the Sahara desert.\n\nSaturday - Back to Marrakech\n\nAfter sunrise we ride by camel back to the vehicle and have the use of a hotel to shower before embarking on our journey back over the High Atlas mountains to Marrakech for our hotel stay and an evening to explore the vibrant city. The contrast between old and new is what makes Marrakech so appealing. Marrakech is buzzing and a must see city. Please note, the hotel in Marrakech is a basic but well located 2 star hotel, please don't expect Western Europe Hotel standards.\n\nSunday\n\nOur long weekend trip ends after breakfast. You can of course extend your stay - we recommend another night so that you can fully enjoy this amazing city. Alternatively it works well to come out to the trip early, have time in Marrakech and then meet the group at the airport at the start of the trip refreshed and already introduced to Morocco.\n\nDiscussion forum - [LINK](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/messages/boards/thread/53638802/)\n\n**Cost & Payment**\n\nThe trip is £356 per person.

The entrance front has six bays and four unequal gables, three of them over projecting bays. In the left projecting gable is a porch, the windows are mullioned and transomed, and at the rear is a semi circular stair turret with a conical roof. It is set in the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\n\nWilderhope Manor is itself quite breath taking and I don't think I'm going to far to call it magical - in the summer it's a popular wedding venue. The past 450 years including it's survival of the English Civil War have helped to shape this historic building, but it's retained much of it's original character from grand fireplaces to substantial oak beams and doors as well as it's quaint leaded windows set in stone frames. The house is set down a long driveway of not far off 1km long and is within substantial grounds in a delightful rural setting. We are surrounded by fields and woodland with only sheep, some birds and nature to break the silence, so to make the most of this idyllic setting we will be eating at the Manor House on Friday night then spending the evening relaxing at the Manor House.\n\nEnough about the house though - the walks we are doing are very nice rather than world class like most of our trips, they are also shorter to allow more time to party and enjoy the Manor House. One explores a labyrinth of beautiful, lush hidden valleys and follows a river up to a spectacular viewpoint. The other walk goes over the unusual and striking ridges that help make the area so unique. Our third walk visits the Cotswolds - an area known for it's great beauty and this also breaks up our drive back on the final day too.\n\n**ITINERARY**\n\nThursday\n\nArrive in the evening at our Manor House and we have time for drinks and socialising and to get to know others on the trip.\n\nFriday\n\nHike: The Long Mynd\nDistance: 13km\nGrading: [Intermediate - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings)\nAscent: 520m\n\nWe'll embark upon a picture postcard valley walk in the Long Mynd near the historic town of Church Stretton. Our trail will follow rivers in several meandering valleys, culminating in reaching a fantastic viewpoint before continuing through hills and lush woodland.\n\nWe will have a three course black tie dinner followed by a party in the Manor House\n\nSaturday\n\nHike: Caer Carodac\nDistance: 12km\nGrading: [Intermediate - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings)\nAscent: 580m\n\nWe’re going to head off for a walk taking in Caer Caradoc Hill and the famous Lawley ridge. Caer Caradoc was once crowned with an ancient fort (there’s debate over whether it’s iron or bronze age). The Lawley is a very defined and quite striking ridge providing some excellent views and a quite unusual ridge walking experience!\n\nAfter the hike we return to the hostel, there is no dinner included tonight, there are a few takeaways in local towns or you can choose to eat out. After dinner we will have time to enjoy the Manor House setting again in the evening with drinks and socialising\n\nSunday\n\nHike: The Cotswolds\nDistance: TBC - likely approx 8 to 14km\nGrading: [Beginner/Intermediate - LINK with details](https://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/pages/11840782/Hike_Gradings)\n\nToday we visit the stunning Cotswolds, which also happens to be on our way back to London so breaks up the drive nicely.
