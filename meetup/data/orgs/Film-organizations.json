This group aims to bring together people who share a common aim - to *see theatre at reasonable prices*.\nAll are welcome at our events - We've met so many lovely people and everyone has been so friendly and enthusiastic.¬†Group sizes vary so we can meet up before and get a chance to talk to each other. We have a great group of organisers with varied tastes and interests; which keeps our calendar filled with mainstream and more eclectic events.\nWith over **2,200 events** in the 10 years we've been going, the variety of shows we've seen is immense.¬†We see a mixture of musicals, plays, opera, ballet, music, comedians and films and are always open to new suggestions!¬†A calender of our events can be found here:¬†[https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar](https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar)\n**There is a one-off joining¬†fee of ¬£2.50**¬†to be a member of **up-in-the-cheap-seats**. These funds will be used to cover the meetup fees and cover expenses associated with running the group.¬†\n\nPlease note, if you are an inactive member for many months (i.e. if you don't log into the website or don't attend any events), you will be removed from the group as we encourage this group to be as active as possible.\nSo......how does it work?¬†\n\n**We buy our own tickets.** Your event organiser will add a link on the event invitation so you can buy your ticket at the same price that they enjoyed. Obviously the price is not guaranteed especially if the show is popular or you wait a few days before booking.\n\n**Please update your RSVP to confirm that you are joining us.** The organiser will normally add a comment to the event page saying which seat they have purchased. This isn‚Äôt mandatory but helps others decide on their seat selection ‚Äì it is always nice to be sat near or next to another member of the group! The group does not charge to attend individual events (just the one-off ¬£2.50 joining fee). Therefore Meetup states that the event is free. This does not mean that your ticket is free - you will need to purchase this yourself.\n\nThe event host will post the meet up details a day or two before the show.\n\nWe usually meet outside the theatre or in one of the theatre's bars around 30 minutes before the show.\n\nIf there is an interval we will meet up again in the bar at the interval so we can all share our opinion of what we have enjoyed (or not!) so far.\n\nWe will also usually meet up afterwards for a brief chat about the show but sometimes (depending on how late it is and the day of the week), we may go on somewhere for a drink and a longer chat.\n\n**If you are unable to make an event, please change your RSVP** so that your host knows not to wait for you.¬†¬†\n\nHope to see you at an event soon,\n**Your UITCS Oraganisers**\n\\*Please note, this group does generate a lot of email, but the good news is these settings are customisable, and can easily be changed by going to 'My Profile',¬†then 'Emails' and 'Notifications'.","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":true,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"33123951","name":"Walking and Wine Women's Group","link":"https://www.meetup.com/walking-and-wine-womens-group","description":"A women's social group for over 40's based around Ealing/West London.\nWalking and wine are two of my favourite things along with good company, food and occasional gallery/film/theatre - events will reflect this.

Books will be set in advance and we will have an online meeting and an in person meeting for most books.\nWe can also delve into movie and TV adaptations, have movie nights with Netflix Party plus social events and quizzes.\nI'm always open to ideas, so feel free to DM me with any suggestions!\nI also co-organise the Horror Book Club, so if you are a fan of the genre in general, please do join us as well\n[https://www.meetup.com/The-Horror-Book-Club/](https://www.meetup.com/The-Horror-Book-Club/)\nAnd always remember - monsters are real!\n\\","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"18985592","name":"Ladies Who Brunch ...and pretty much do everything else too","link":"https://www.meetup.com/ladies-that-brunch-and-pretty-much-do-everything-else-too","description":"<p>This group is ideal for women who are time-poor and want to be able to drop in to social meetups with like-minded individuals at similar stages in their lives.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Many women I know struggle with the same problem as they hit their mid-twenties/ thirties with most of their social network spread out all over the country.&nbsp;Many of us have moved from our hometowns, friends are scattered all over the place and long working hours make it pretty difficult to commit to hobbies.&nbsp;This Surrey-based member's group is designed to be low maintenance but there when you want it, as and when you are free.</p><p><br /></p><p>The group is always open to suggestions for things to do, but will start on the basis of all things from fitness (runs, yoga, walks, gym sessions, dance classes) to coffee catch-ups, new lunch venues, as well as golf, film, fashion and career conversations/ networking.&nbsp;We welcome anyone to host a meetup, so if you'd like to see more events near you or fancy a particular activity, why not have a go? Similarly, If you have any hobbies or passions we could incorporate that you would like to share or teach - we would be thrilled. Just let me, Charlie, know.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ultimately, this group is a great way to take a moment out of our busy lives, put the world to rights, share hobbies and skills, network, and enjoy those odd free evenings and weekends in the company of some amazing women.</p><p><br /></p><p>****************************************************&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Kindly Note:&nbsp;</p><p>- Please ensure first names and photos are included on your profiles for membership consideration&nbsp;</p><p>- We hope that this group will be full of fun, enthusiastic members, please contribute and RSVP where reasonable. It can be daunting attending an event for the first time - but please don't be nervous. The meetups are low-key and filled with genuinely amazing, friendly women.</p><p>- We welcome women of any age to join.</p><p>- Most of the meetups will be free, but to accommodate any charged events or visiting speakers/experts, some of the meetups may involve a small fee or deposit. Charged events include things such as theatre visits, cinema, lectures, exercise classes etc.&nbsp;Any fees will of course be communicated well in advance.</p><p>- To cover the cost of having the meetup group (currently ¬£120/year), the meetup owner, Charlie, may negotiate with paid activity organisers for compensation, such as covering their ticket cost - this won't affect members and any fees will be communicated well in advance.</p><p>- If you would like to share a paid event with the group, where funds will go to yourself or someone you know, please ask the group owner, Charlie, in advance.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking forward to meeting you.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks and enjoy!</p>","city":"Twickenham","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false}]
