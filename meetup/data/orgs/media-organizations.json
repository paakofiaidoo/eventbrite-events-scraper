All are welcome 🌍\n\nMeet like-minded people for new friendships.\n\nThen come on out and join us for our Free Speed Friending social!\n\nWe arrange for you to meet and chat with each other. This gives you an easy and convenient way to meet new people in a way that completely dissolves barriers. This is NOT speed dating and so you will be meeting both ladies and gentlemen in mixed groups. The intent is to create friendships.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits is that this tears down the walls of shyness. Many people have deep-seated anxiety when it comes to talking to people they don’t know. But when you push outside your comfort zones, this speedy connection opens up the door to allow you to easily communicate and work together with other members of the group.\n\nSpeed friending allows you to identify other people with common interests. The conversations that take place don’t have to be deep, profound or even scripted; simply discussing likes and dislikes may lead to future friendships. Often, people want to make new friends, but they aren’t quite sure how to go about it. With speed friending, you can start pursuing that goal.\n\nHow to participate: Free Events\nDownload the Zoom app for free on a desktop or mobile device.\nAfter you click attend, you'll see the Zoom link to join the event.\n\nWhat happens in the event:\n\n1️⃣ Upon entering the event you will be in our virtual lobby where our event hosts will welcome you.

We have a great group of organisers with varied tastes and interests; which keeps our calendar filled with mainstream and more eclectic events.\nWith over **2,200 events** in the 10 years we've been going, the variety of shows we've seen is immense. We see a mixture of musicals, plays, opera, ballet, music, comedians and films and are always open to new suggestions! A calender of our events can be found here: [https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar](https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar)\n**There is a one-off joining fee of £2.50** to be a member of **up-in-the-cheap-seats**.

Obviously the price is not guaranteed especially if the show is popular or you wait a few days before booking.\n\n**Please update your RSVP to confirm that you are joining us.** The organiser will normally add a comment to the event page saying which seat they have purchased. This isn’t mandatory but helps others decide on their seat selection – it is always nice to be sat near or next to another member of the group! The group does not charge to attend individual events (just the one-off £2.50 joining fee). Therefore Meetup states that the event is free. This does not mean that your ticket is free - you will need to purchase this yourself.\n\nThe event host will post the meet up details a day or two before the show.\n\nWe usually meet outside the theatre or in one of the theatre's bars around 30 minutes before the show.\n\nIf there is an interval we will meet up again in the bar at the interval so we can all share our opinion of what we have enjoyed (or not!) so far.\n\nWe will also usually meet up afterwards for a brief chat about the show but sometimes (depending on how late it is and the day of the week), we may go on somewhere for a drink and a longer chat.\n\n**If you are unable to make an event, please change your RSVP** so that your host knows not to wait for you.  \n\nHope to see you at an event soon,\n**Your UITCS Oraganisers**\n\\*Please note, this group does generate a lot of email, but the good news is these settings are customisable, and can easily be changed by going to 'My Profile', then 'Emails' and 'Notifications'.","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":true,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"34970178","name":"London Black Chicks Network","link":"https://www.meetup.com/london-black-chicks-network","description":"**CLEAR PICTURE OF YOURSELF NEEDED TO JOIN.

This is a community for Chinese and English learners of all levels to learn from one another in a relaxed social environment. Our goals are to have fun, improve language skills through conversation and build a community for Chinese and English learners.\n\n**Why are we different?**\n\n* Structured time to maximise learning\n* Facilitated conversations\n* Help on hand\n\n**Who is it for?**\n\n* Anyone learning Chinese who would like to improve and practice with native speakers\n* Chinese speakers looking to improve their English skills with native speakers\n* Learners of all levels\n\n**Format- Speed-chatting!**\n\n* We will pair you up with a native speaker of your target language.\n* We will provide fun, engaging topics to prompt your chat.\n* Every 30 minutes we rotate with different people. This ensures we cover a diverse range of vocabulary and you get to speak to as many people as possible, making the best use of your time here!\n\n**FAQs:**\n**1\\. Are the sessions suitable for Beginners?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so beginners will at least learn the short answers to questions like: 'what's your favorite food and where can I get it?' 'Chinese food at China Town!' From then, you can slowly build up your repertoire.\n\n**2\\. Are the sessions suitable for intermediate/advanced speakers?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so no matter what level you are at, you will be able to practice it to your level.\n\n**3\\. Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?**\nNo, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for at least half the session with our 'Speed-chatting' format!\n\n**About the host**\nChina Unbound hosts this meetup.

Trips to watch sports or to play petanque may also be organised.\n* Please say on your profile which of our regular and occasional activities you are interested in! *Note: Badminton used to be organised (and coaching may still be available), but there is at least three other meetup groups in the area who regularly do this sport (plus some 'no strings badminton') further details available from Dave or David).*\n\n*• Note: If you are interested in bridge locally and online please go to: [https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/) .*\n\nThere are a roughly equal number of men and women in the group, and members are of various ages from 20's to over 60.\nTemporary local residents or visitors to the area from other parts or the country or from overseas are welcome to join if they regularly come to the area or before a visit.\n\\*If the group is 'full' there may be a delay in accepting you in to the group (but this will be done as soon as possible).\n\\*\\*If you are interested in organising a certain activity please contact Dave.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\\*\\*: Golf details: Events are organised at Courses\\* to suit experienced, intermediate and improver players mainly.

Lucy and Isabelle co-founded Divorce Club back in 2016 for one simple reason – we know that no one should go through divorce alone! It's now the largest Divorce Club in the UK.**\n\nYou may be feeling lonely, unsupported or simply looking for friendly help & advice in order to move on. Afterall, what other life event can uproot you from your home, shake your financial security, reduce your time with your children and make friends and family disappear overnight? Sometimes you don’t know where to turn, or just feel angry or sad.\n\nThat’s where we at Divorce Club London can help.\n\nWe know it can be really tough going through a divorce. It’s hard to find people who know how you feel unless they’ve been through it. Divorce Club London is hosted by people who have been through a divorce and who know exactly what you’re going through (whatsmore our co-founder Isabelle is a clinical psychologist). So we know that the best remedy for the pain of divorce is to meet others in the same boat and make a fresh start. We also know that trying to navigate the legal and financial side is an additional pressure, just when you’re at your lowest ebb.\n\nDivorce Club London connects people to every single resource they may need to get through a divorce from the moment of separation to moving on and meeting someone new. We aim to reduce the sense of isolation and overwhelm in the first stage of separation but also look to help people identify how to look forward and rebuild their lives. We fundamentally believe out of the ashes of the end of a relationship, new beginnings and a huge opportunity for growth arise.\n\nFor newly separated people we offer advice and help on the process and emotional overwhelm. As people go through the process they have continuous access to legal and financial advice while also being able to tap into a community of people who can share the roller coaster of milestones, difficulties and triumphs. And for those in the later stages we offer coaching for goal setting, and online sessions for moving on, dating and growth.\n\nDivorce Club London provides expert information that takes the mystery and fear out of divorce. We have guest speakers from top law firms, mediators, psychologists, parenting experts, divorce coaches, financial advisors, dating experts and many more - advice that usually costs a lot of money!\n\nFor less than the price of a weekly takeout coffee, you can join us and meet other people who know exactly what you’re going through.\n\nMembership includes access to:\n\n* Weekly social zoom calls\n* Legal Q&As with respected family lawyers\n* Financial Q&As\n* Parenting sessions\n* Goal setting\n* Book clubs\n* Divorce orientated workshops\n* Access to a 24/7 community messaging channel\n* In real life meetups and socials\n\nFor just £7.99 a month, you can get inclusive access to all of our events, access to chat in our private community, and a service which aims to match you with friends. We even give you the first month for free.\nWhatsmore, we host a free Meetup group session once a month so you can come and see what Divorce Club is all about.\n\nSo we hope that you invest in giving yourself a better divorce, and a better recovery. We passionately believe that you can have an amazing life after divorce! There is such an opportunity for growth and many of our members have said how much happier they are two, three, four years down the line – so hang on in there.

It is an exciting and fun way to stay fit: it is challenging, both physically and mentally, and a great way to exercise! I remember walking pass the Arch at Bermondsey and wondering “where on earth are those people walking to, especially with those funny shoes hanging from their backpacks” before I knew it I was one of those people! lol\n\nI plan to have weekly bouldering Meet-ups for people who are curious about bouldering or like bouldering and want to have some good company and vibes while at it. We can cheer each other on and work on problems together!\n\nAll levels are welcome! Even if you are a complete beginner, though kindly please watch the safety intro video ([The Arch Climbing Wall - Safety Intro ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBTStDqP_9c)) and fill out the [register online form here ](https://signups.archclimbingwall.com/)\\- please make sure to watch the video all the way through as there is important info in it that you’ll be asked a few questions about on your very first visit to the Arch centre\\. Nevertheless\\, you will have your fellow Bermondsey Boulders to support you on your very first climb and future climbs :\\-\\)\n\nI am sure the intermediate and advance climbers will be happy to share some tips when you attend, I know I will need it lol. Let’s get to know each other and help each other out to make this group a positive and fulfilling experience for everyone.\n\nTwice a week, from 6:30pm on Wednesday and 11:00am on Sundays we will be meeting at the Surrey Quays Arch & Bermondsey Arch. Let us enjoy bouldering together. The entrance is within the biscuit factory compound that also has the PureGym Bermondsey branch. For the Surrey Quays centre, you can't miss it just go to the Shopping centre entrance and it will be on your left.\n\nAll you need to bring are a comfortable change of clothes that are easy to move in. The Arch provides lockers to keep your personal belongings safe as well.\n\nThe Surrey Quays branch is now completed this new Rotherhithe SE16 branch is located in the heart of the biggest Shopping Complex in the Borough, so cool right? And do not worry, it is literally the same distance you will travel from Bermondsey Station to Arch one. \n\nAfter the Sunday session, let us have lunch together at the famous Bermondsey Maltby Street Market..it is a 15 minute walk from the Arch.…. They have a good variety of cooked food to buy.. yum!\n\nThis event is completely free to attend, and the only costs you have to bear are the Arch fees and/or shoe rental.\n\nIndoor bouldering is safe (if you follow the guidelines) and offers a great workout, no matter what your age! So if you have ever been curious about the sport of bouldering, or wanting to get back into it with some company this group is a great place to start in what I hope will be a safe and friendly atmosphere for you. Check out some of our session's highlights here - https://www.meetup.com/bermondsey-boulders/photos/\n\nThe bouldering sessions will be taking place in the Arch centres (bouldering only) in SE16.
