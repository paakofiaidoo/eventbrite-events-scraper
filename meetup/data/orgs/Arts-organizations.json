I have made a decision that every year the group will focus on a different way to explore our beautiful city and connect to likeminded people.\n\nFollowing the last 2 years of Covid and restrictions, it is only natural that we now all value the simpler things in life we might have taken for granted before, more deeply.\n\nI am inviting you to see your life, your world with new eyes....\nI am inviting you to become an explorer in your own city.\nAn explorer in the world.\nAn explorer with yourself and others.\nI invite you to awaken awe and playfulness and see what happens....\n\nWhether you have just moved to London or have lived here all your life, or if you live outside of London but always wanted to explore the forgotten or hidden parts of London, while meeting new people then this invitation is for you, if deep down inside you have an adventurer and explorer waiting to come out! All adults are welcome.\n\nI will be running a variety of events: my aim is to put events together that will unite people to come together in this amazing city (and sometimes even venture further afield!) and just have fun. And in the process slow down to really take in the beauty that is life and make magic moments. \n\n\n\n\n**IS THIS GROUP FOR YOU?**\nThis is for you if you are an adventurer/explorer at heart, you are open to new experiences, curious, energetic and enthusiastic about life and living in London and interested in exploring it in different ways. For me the lure of setting up this group wasn't just about getting out the house to see the city I have lived in for so many years but rather to explore London, in a new and exciting way! And it goes much deeper than that: it's about creating a sense of novelty, awe and wonder about our lives and our surroundings. For all we think we know so well and there's nothing left to discover, once we decide we are at heart \"intrepid explorers\" in our own lives and in our own city then we can choose to see everything around us with curiosity and fresh eyes and a renewed sense of wonder. It's an almost child like ability of playfulness, that we tend to lose as we become adults. This is what I hope to achieve with this group: recapture our sense of playfulness, discovery and wonder, while making connections with others! The magical moments happen when we are brave enough to explore and then make a connection with others on the same path!\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE:**\nI spent years working in top 5 star hotels as a Concierge so I got to know all the secret places that few people know about in London. In addition to that I have a passion for London and it's unique character and all the gems it hides in plain sight!I have escorted some friends and even business clients through London and they all loved how they were shown parts of London they didn't expect to see, and how much they enjoyed it! I am now also a Life Coach and Healer, so I love the idea of connecting people especially now following an extended period of Covid that will have affected our mental health and ability to connect with others. \n\nPlease feel free to drop me a line and suggest any events/activities you would like to take part in...all suggestions are welcome!","city":"London","state":"17","country":"gb","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"23191778","name":"WYBTD?

We don't mind coming up at some point with a new name, let us know of any great name you have in mind.\nWe ran Figure Drawing classes since 2004 when there was only about 10 2D Figure Drawing classes left in London UK. This was the time when Ipad/Wacom tablet classes started to overtake. We, I mean I went a bit mad about it and by influencing as much as humanly possible we had 650 classes weekly in London in 2013 and run about 120 in 10 years, in all areas of the city, was seen on Tele, Radio, press regularly. This crusade was about anything and everything but capital gain and hasn't changed. For absolutely everyone to be able to draw, Online zoom classes are perfect as you always get the best seat and can use equipment that you can never use at the Local weekly classes.\n\n**Classes:**\n**Saturday and Sunday** every 2 weeks I meet Londoners in Central London Park, Hyde Park corner and gently push others like Clissold Park Locals to do the same, like I did, as those are Free events. If I am in Brighton someone else's welcomes guests on the day.\n**Monday:** Every Monday as this is the most regular class of the week, I or someone I trust guide the group which again is only possible online, for 1/2 the session. Then I turn my camera towards my Drawing board or using the chat on zoom, help those who turn their own camera on their drawings. Other participants will never hear, see anything so a bit like private tuition. This is something offered only to those who really mean to achieve results in the future and need to pay a tiny ¬£5/week that helps me pay the models with and all our video and running of our website. Without those people keen to achieve and me absolutely keen to help them none of all this would ever be possible.\nThose who don't need help on that day simply put the volume down.\n**Tuesday** is our together day for a little extra Socializing and to draw each other's faces mainly. Sometime hands, or feet, Costumes, hats, jewelry etc... To keep the experience fun fun fun who ever poses must do a funny face before the more or less still posing for 20 mins :). If you llok like anyone let me know so more will turn up. The first time we did one one those, before any Doodle events ever existed was in 2006 and was called Happy Drawing Circles with up to 20 in each circle.\n**Wednesday** about every 2 weeks depending on level of attendance we do Exceptional Life Drawing themes that most attendees go to Live or continue drawing after the class from the recordings if they are Weekly members (¬£5 all incl.)\n**Thursday** is our Partly clothed to completely clothed/costumed models day also every 2 weeks on Low season and weekly otherwise.\nTo recapitulate: A live experience cost ¬£2.50, A live experience and/or working from the recording is ¬£10 or the weekly pass inclusive of all events is ¬£5/week or ¬£7.50 for Pro Class organizers who need little help.\nFor a complete list of what this Pass gives you feel free to read our Prices page at www.thelifedrawingnetwork.com\n**The motivation** part is also in our pricing as if you Buy a ¬£10 ticket to be able to work/finish your work from a video, if you email us a Drawing that we can exhibit on our Life Arts Gallery page, we refund ¬£7 and will show your Art to potential buyers/investors.\nIf you want or intend to model one day for classes we let people give it a go at the end of any of our classes and offer Completely Free services to them for Life, my life.\nIf you or someone you know would like to be promoted for anything in person, from Artist, Art teacher, Class organizer, Art writer, let me know.\nWe'll be writing the History of Comtemporary Figure drawing so please share good old times stories...
