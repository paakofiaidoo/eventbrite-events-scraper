Our calendar is jam packed with activities, with the intention of having “something for everyone” and nobody gets left behind.\nYou will notice on our rides that we use a colour code system to differentiate the difficulty. To understand this better and to work out which level you are at please read our ability guide here:\nhttps://claphamcycleclub.com/[abilityguide/](https://claphamcycle.com/abilityguide/)\nWe now have over 190 registered members, with 3-4 rides every week, and with multiple trips abroad.\nIn 2019 we completed 256 events in total and for 2020 we aim to complete even more!\nJoin us, meet some new friends, and become a part of the fastest growing cycling community around.\n*Please read out Do's & Donts before attending any of our rides (link below)*\n*[http://www.meetup.com/Clapham-Cycle/pages/Clapham_Cycle_-_Do%27s_and_Don%27ts](http://www.meetup.com/Clapham-Cycle/pages/Clapham_Cycle_-_Do%27s_and_Don%27ts)*\n**Pace Groups**\nWe will never allow more than 10 people in a group, so we if have more than one leader we will split into two or three groups. We will then split the pace the best we can, the faster riders in group 1 and so fourth. So 1 leader equals 10 cyclists, this is why you will see wait-list for a while until another leader confirms.\n**RSVP Rules**\nOur rides are getting very popular, please only RSVP if you are serious about coming. There is nothing worse than having no-shows and then people on the wait list missing out. If you no-show 3 times without 24 hours cancellation notice you will be removed from the group.\n**Use Strava?**\nWe have our own club, please join! [https://www.strava.com/clubs/199520](https://www.strava.com/clubs/199520)\n**Facebook**\nLike us on Facebook! This builds awareness and helps u grown the community.

Whether you are looking to improve your group riding skills, get fit, train for a big event, or just looking to meet fellow minded people, then the Rouleurs could be the club for you! \nWe are a non-profit organisation run entirely by volunteers. The club is affiliated with British Cycling and for as little as £35 per year our members get to take part in weekly rides, socials, holidays, training events, etc. If wanting to join as a full member then please go to [http://rprouleurs.co.uk/membership](http://rprouleurs.co.uk/membership). \nOur main ethos is to ride as a group, we stop for punctures, and leave nobody behind. We have many groups out of varying levels with the main purpose of getting back to the pub safely for a few beers with the rest of the team, though most club rides will require you to be able to ride 40-50 miles. If you are concerned about keeping up, then talk to one of our more experienced members.\nWe schedule laps around Richmond Park most Saturdays to encourage new members along. Whether a beginner or an experienced rider, we can find you the right paced group to ride with and meet some of the regulars on a nice leisurely ride.\nDon't forget to check out our [website](http://rprouleurs.co.uk) and social networks on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/richmondparkrouleurs/), [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/RPRouleurs)and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rprouleurs/)!\nWhy not purchase some of our club kit and feel really part of the club!

The aim of the group is to have meetups on a regular basis aiming for members to meet-up at least a couple of times a month. All events endeavour to allow members to get to know each other in an intimate sociable setting to enjoy a feeling of 'friends getting together'. To encourage this, we may limit numbers of attendees for certain events and the group has a cap on the number of members at 40.</p><p><br /></p><p>The membership fee is £10 on joining and then £10 every year paid by standing order to be paid on July 2nd each year – to coincide with Meet Up’s annual fee payment.&nbsp;It is important that you meet up with the group before your membership is approved.</p><p><br /></p><p>All paid-up members automatically become ‘event-organisers’ allowing them to put up events.</p><p><br /></p><p>Events - All members are expected to put up an event at some stage so that everyone appreciates the efforts that go into running the group. However, this is by rotation of members and only one member has to do this each month, so if we have 40 members your turn will only come around every 40 months! Outside of \"your month\",&nbsp;you can put up any number of events you wish, but please consider the day you put up events to avoid clashes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Age range - Membership is limited to the over 45s to encourage common ground amongst the ladies.</p><p><br /></p><p>Photos - When you join ELSG you are asked to include a photo that identifies you. This helps us spot newcomers at events. Some people choose to put up a photo of an inanimate object, which is unhelpful thus we are unable to accept members without a full-face picture.</p><p><br /></p><p>RSVP - Once you decide to attend an event you must RSVP it. This lets the organiser and members know who they should look out for at the event. If no one RSVPs an event, it may be cancelled or rescheduled – so it is not advisable to just turn up without RSVPing! Moreover, if you RSVP an event and fail to turn-up you could leave the host hanging around by themselves – PLEASE BE CONSIDERATE!</p><p><br /></p><p>First-timers - The first time you RSVP an event it is advisable to let the event organiser know this is your first time so they can make sure they look out for you or perhaps exchange numbers with you in case of any last minutes changes. There is a comment box beneath each event where you can enter text which is the best way to liaise with the event organiser.</p><p><br /></p><p>Termination of membership – this is very rare! If you are considerate, friendly (especially to new-comers), non-cliquing, capable, reliable and engage with the ELSG site to keep up with events and notifications then I do not imagine you’ll have any issues :o)</p><p><br /></p><p>ELSG has been running for seven years now and experience has shown us that members who run into difficulties are those who imagine that ELSG is an automated system – it is not, humans run it. It is important that members refer to the site to keep updated on events and news - no one has the time to hold your hand :o(</p><p><br /></p><p>Last and most importantly - overall, we're a friendly group who enjoy a glass or two. If you fancy joining, have no major hang-ups and you’re friendly and enjoy a natter in addition to being a lady of a certain age, then ELSG is possibly the meet-up group for you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope to meet you at an event soon!</p><p><br /></p><p>Maria</p><blockquote><br /></blockquote><blockquote><br /></blockquote>",

All are welcome 🌍\n\nMeet like-minded people for new friendships.\n\nThen come on out and join us for our Free Speed Friending social!\n\nWe arrange for you to meet and chat with each other. This gives you an easy and convenient way to meet new people in a way that completely dissolves barriers. This is NOT speed dating and so you will be meeting both ladies and gentlemen in mixed groups. The intent is to create friendships.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits is that this tears down the walls of shyness. Many people have deep-seated anxiety when it comes to talking to people they don’t know. But when you push outside your comfort zones, this speedy connection opens up the door to allow you to easily communicate and work together with other members of the group.\n\nSpeed friending allows you to identify other people with common interests. The conversations that take place don’t have to be deep, profound or even scripted; simply discussing likes and dislikes may lead to future friendships. Often, people want to make new friends, but they aren’t quite sure how to go about it. With speed friending, you can start pursuing that goal.\n\nHow to participate: Free Events\nDownload the Zoom app for free on a desktop or mobile device.\nAfter you click attend, you'll see the Zoom link to join the event.\n\nWhat happens in the event:\n\n1️⃣ Upon entering the event you will be in our virtual lobby where our event hosts will welcome you.

The meetup is open to professionals living and residing in London, so there are questions to fill in before applying. We will meet inside all the pubs of greater London. Pubs with too strong music or too thematic or little will not be selected, but we will endeavour to get inside all of the pubs. We will endeavour to visit all the pubs of London, so we will meet within the same pub only if the pub is very little and there will be a limited number of spots. In this case the people that have already been at that pub will not be allowed to join again to give to other people the opportunity to see that pub. Every week we will meet inside a certain pub and we will explore a different area only when we have called at all the pubs of the previous one. For example if we start with the pubs in Shepherds Bush we will get to all the pubs within the shepherds Bush area. There will be a charge only for selected meetings.\nPlease note : you don't have to purchase alcohol if you don't want to, the important thing is that you purchase something that appeals to you. At the end of the year or so you can say that you have visited all the pubs of London at least the ones within zone 1 and 2. Please note : we will only go inside public houses. Discos and bars are not included.\nThis Meetup group is not open to un respectful people, and is open to diversity, the attitude of members will be monitored by the organisers that pay the fees. Members will be monitored. Membership of other members requires approval.",

Also note, our meetups will generally be held over the weekends as this is most best for most people and the weekend is the best time to have some fun....Stay blessed. &lt;br&gt;</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>Please note that two No Shows will result in removal from the Group (which no one wants).

        "description": "Welcome to **up-in-the-cheap-seats**. This group aims to bring together people who share a common aim - to *see theatre at reasonable prices*.\nAll are welcome at our events - We've met so many lovely people and everyone has been so friendly and enthusiastic. Group sizes vary so we can meet up before and get a chance to talk to each other. We have a great group of organisers with varied tastes and interests; which keeps our calendar filled with mainstream and more eclectic events.\nWith over **2,200 events** in the 10 years we've been going, the variety of shows we've seen is immense. We see a mixture of musicals, plays, opera, ballet, music, comedians and films and are always open to new suggestions! A calender of our events can be found here: [https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar](https://www.meetup.com/Up-in-the-cheap-seats/events/calendar)\n**There is a one-off joining fee of £2.50** to be a member of **up-in-the-cheap-seats**. These funds will be used to cover the meetup fees and cover expenses associated with running the group. \n\nPlease note, if you are an inactive member for many months (i.e. if you don't log into the website or don't attend any events), you will be removed from the group as we encourage this group to be as active as possible.\nSo......how does it work? \n\n**We buy our own tickets.** Your event organiser will add a link on the event invitation so you can buy your ticket at the same price that they enjoyed. Obviously the price is not guaranteed especially if the show is popular or you wait a few days before booking.\n\n**Please update your RSVP to confirm that you are joining us.** The organiser will normally add a comment to the event page saying which seat they have purchased. This isn’t mandatory but helps others decide on their seat selection – it is always nice to be sat near or next to another member of the group! The group does not charge to attend individual events (just the one-off £2.50 joining fee). Therefore Meetup states that the event is free. This does not mean that your ticket is free - you will need to purchase this yourself.\n\nThe event host will post the meet up details a day or two before the show.\n\nWe usually meet outside the theatre or in one of the theatre's bars around 30 minutes before the show.\n\nIf there is an interval we will meet up again in the bar at the interval so we can all share our opinion of what we have enjoyed (or not!) so far.\n\nWe will also usually meet up afterwards for a brief chat about the show but sometimes (depending on how late it is and the day of the week), we may go on somewhere for a drink and a longer chat.\n\n**If you are unable to make an event, please change your RSVP** so that your host knows not to wait for you.  \n\nHope to see you at an event soon,\n**Your UITCS Oraganisers**\n\\*Please note, this group does generate a lot of email, but the good news is these settings are customisable, and can easily be changed by going to 'My Profile', then 'Emails' and 'Notifications'.",

It seemed impossible to find fun, reasonably priced and most importantly brilliantly hosted singles events. So we decided to host our own and we truly love what we do.\n\nUnlike other meet up groups we are actually a full time run business, with a brand new website and members account area so you can match and message with anyone you meet at one of our events. We also have customer service 7 days a week to handle any questions you may have.\n\nOur speed dating and singles social events are mainly targeted at men and women aged 25- 55 in the London area and are hosted by our professional team. Creating a friendly yet exciting environment, our hosts are there to keep things relaxed yet exciting and help with those all important ice-breakers. They don't just say hi and leave you to it, they'll be there the whole night making sure everyone is having a great time.\n\nAnd our True Dating guarantee is if you don't meet at least one person you'd like to match with at any of our events, your next event is completely free!\n\nTo find out more about us and book tickets please check out our website: www.truedating.co.uk",

We will also endeavour to book venues which are accessible for people with mobility issues, and will make it clear in the event description whether the venue is accessible.\n\nAs we are starting out, we may need to try out several different venues to find one that works well.

Whether it's a particular genre of music/club night/dancing,  theatre/acting, food, singing/rockaoake, sports/fitness, comedy, art, pub crawls, cutting edge science, spirituality actvities - we host free fun themed events to ensure only like minded people with the same passions get to meet and particpate as life is too short to spend time with people who do not excite and or engage you.\n\nOur membership is biased towards successful but unpretentious career professionals with highly engaging personalities who are are socially skilled, outgoing, intellectually curious and creative with outstanding sense of humour! We value quality over mediocrity so attempt to constrict attendees to people with an authentic love of the event theme to both foster good engagement dynamics & keep attendees to a manageable size.\n\nOur London events are hosted by a born Londoner who know the city and hidden gems inside out! We also avoid holding events in touristy/sleazy venues so attendees get to enjoy authentic London venues & experiences and meet native brits anf form long lasting connections easily. Typical past events have included stargazing, rockaoke, music themed clubbing events (80s, 90s, 70s, 50s, Hip Hop & Reggae nights), sports events (badminton, rounders, tennis), Halloween pub crawls/tours, exhibitions, dinners/food tasting/supper club, lunches/brunch, coffee, firework displays, talks/seminars, concerts - you name it - we've done it!\n\nWaiting lists wise - when places become available, preference will be given to people with complete profiles who can demonstrate a genuine passion for the event theme, to the most loyal members and those with a close proximity to event location so it is parmount you fill out your profile!!\n\nAnd here at Chillout, our philosophy is you shouldn't have to pay a premium to enjoy the things that you love so in accordance with the fundamental founding tenet of Meetup - the vast majority of our events are free - no profit motive here! However in rare cases, where direct or venue hiring costs are incurred for putting on a specific event, there maybe a small charge.\n\nSo, whether you’re originally from London or brand new to the city, here's to enjoying some memoriable crazy times out with a select audience and even forming strong new authentic long lasting connections along the way.\n\nLucas - Founder & Organiser (and essay writer!)\n***Please note, if you are identified to having different motives for attending events other than for socialising around a shared theme that you are truly passionate about or found to be harassing members or seeking sexual conquests you will be removed. For security screening and protecting our members - everyone must have a full face pic prior to attending an event so they can be indentified in the case of any issues. If any ladies recieve unsolicited contact from random people they have never met please feel free to report to me (so I can remove) and contact meetup site directly.*** \n\nFeel free to follow us on Twitter to Keep updated with new events here:\nhttps://twitter.com/Chillout_London\nhttps://twitter.com/LucasBulsara\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nAnd now for some blatant testimonial marketing (generous bank transfers on way):\n\n\"His energy, event passion, beauty and brief conversation shifted my mindset tremendously in less than a few minutes which is very rare when attending meetups\" Clare\n\n\"I went to Chillout London when I was new to the city from the USA and I always had a really great time. Everyone was super friendly. Lucas always has cool captivating themes and I always felt deeply engaged, never bored. I would definitely recommend!\" Staci Schidmt\n\n\"The organiser is late often and as a former teacher I have no idea how he made it through school or university without being expelled but his events are so novel & addictive I just can't stay away\" Reena Teacher\n\n\"Meeting Lucas and attending his event was a lovely experience. He had so much knowledge and passion. It was really good. Very impressive\" Komal\n\n\"It's about time Lucas grew up, got a girlfriend/got married like the rest of his mates instead of wasting his time on this meetup nonsense. He should be hanging out with his real friends!\" Adam Joslin\n\n\"The organiser is one of the funniest entertaining people I've met. He is really passionate about all his event themes and so there is always an air of excitement and never a dull moment. Now I'm a semi regular - I always leave either learning something new or laughing on the way home\"  Lorraine Norton\n\n\"Organiser jokes around a lot but I love him. When he was DJing at his club event party he refused to play Never Tear Us Apart for me so if you like good music I suggest you avoid Chillout events\" Dominika Abel (Assitant Organiser)",

It has never been.\n\nWe need developers to help save water and energy, and prolong the lives of both humans and animals. The list of challenges is too long to list all of them here.\n\nHowever, it takes months to find a suitable developer for a project, even in the world of finance, where money is not the biggest problem. Now try to imagine, how hard may it be for nature-related projects, like NationalTrust (UK), Greenpeace, and many others.\n\nThat is where we help. We help people of any degree of IT proficiency to get into OpenSource. We help people to become a true part of the Open Source Community. Our goal is to help them to impact society in the most positive way, while quickly and powerfully progressing their IT skills.\n\nOur goal is not to grow the “alike developers”, but rather to help each person to realize this individual’s strengths and build on these.\nEvery single person with the most basic IT knowledge can contribute to OpenSource, a lot.\n\nNo coding skills are actually required. Numerous roles in Open Source do not require coding skills.\nAlso, you might notice that your coding skills will just appear, at some point in the future ;)\n\nWe need to give this world a chance.\n\nWe need more contributors.\n**We need YOU.**",

Some events are Free Entry and some are paid gigs with a cheap Guest-List. It's a group for friends to meet people and organise nights out together :)\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nThe Live Music Industry is unfortunately not what it used to be 20 years ago - Nowadays, an Artist is judged on how many ‘Likes’ and ’Thumbs-Up’ they can get on a Facebook page…\n\nWe live in London the MUSIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\n\nIf you don’t believe that there are amazing nights of music playing all-night long, then you haven’t been paying attention.\n\nI am offering any Band or Artist currently performing around London an Instagram ‘Follow’ if they want it. I have lived here all my life and I know great music events happen everyday because I’ve been there, seen it and I am happy to support it. Last year has probably been the hardest for many Musicians - Nearly all the best Live Music Venues have closed down - BIG RED / LOCK TAVERN / THE MONARCH and many others. Most Alternative Music has been pushed to East LONDON and It's pretty hard getting gigs. So, I will be hosting a few MUSICIANS MEETUPS and I welcome anyone playing music or searching for fellow musicians to come down for a drink 🙂🍻\n\nOver the last 5 years of running this Group, I have had a lot of people come and express an interest in meeting other musicians to form bands. It’s difficult meeting the right people so if you are a Singer, Guitarist, Bassist or Drummer, have a band or think there’s anything we might be interested in then this might be a good group for you.\nWe put on our own nights and are always looking for great bands to see around London. If you are looking for Gigs or reliable promoters, then we can probably help point you in the right direction.\n\nAt the very least, we can talk music and then watch some bands :)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nWe are not responsible for you or your belongings. By attending events you agree to waiver liability for the Host :) Please bring ID to all events 18+ Thank you",

If you fancy a trip to an art gallery, a walk in the woods, or a chat over dinner where you can connect with more people, you have come to the right place.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Our regular Monthly Meet ups include:</span></p>\n<p><span>A monthly Supper Club that tours the eateries of East London. Hosted by Róisín and Mel.</span></p>\n<p>A monthly gathering to see the drag show 'Drag Out the Weekend' at the Northcote pub in Leyton/Leytonstone.&nbsp; A space to catch up with other ELL members, enjoy great gastro pub food and watch a different drag act each month.

Obviously, this excludes emergencies. We just ask you let us know in good time that you can't come.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We encourage members to host events that they are interested in and we would be delighted to support you if you wish to host an event that interests you in an area/venue you're familiar with.

NPD is rarely diagnosed, as the narcissist believes “there’s nothing wrong with me and it’s everybody else who is at fault. It's usually the victim that presents at therapy. If you’ve been around someone who gaslights you, has frightening rages at perceived slights, you feel like you are walking on eggshells, belittles you, is very controlling, has delusions of grandeur, thinks they are better than everyone else, creates a smear campaign against you if you question their character, has a charming/caring side to the outside world which makes you question your sanity and beliefs, you have very possibly encountered someone with NPD.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The abuse is insidious and erodes the victim's sense of self, you feel trapped in the FOG (fear, obligation and guilt) you know there is something very wrong but make excuses to justify the emotionally manipulative abuse. </p><p>The journey from discovery to recovery can be very frightening, isolating and extremely difficult to articulate to anyone who has been fortunate enough not to have encountered a narcissist.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>A fellow survivor wrote \"I fully understand the roller coaster of emotions and sense of isolation we can experience, as we are often called crazy, hyper-sensitive and gaslighted along the way. I believe a key part of the healing process is to exchange personal stories with those who have an understanding of the pain that narcissistic abuse can cause. This validation is often of vital importance in our recovery process from narcissistic abuse\". I absolutely second that statement and hence the beginning of Discovery to Recovery of Narcissistic Abuse support group.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this group can help give you comfort from knowing you are not alone and you are not going crazy! We are here to support you along the road from discovery to recovery to thriving, from this insidious, misunderstood, personality disorder.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Sarah J x&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>*** Please ensure your profile title has a first name and surname or initial so that co organisers can identify members.***&nbsp;</p>",

Come on then ladies lets build a Circle of Friends!\nOccasionally some venues are small so numbers will be restricted, we normally have a waiting list for these events in case someone can't make it, so click on the rsvp anyway and that will add you to the wait list, and check back near the time to see if you have been added to the event.\nSo you can't find something to fit in with your commitments, why not host an event?

However, if you don’t live in that area you can still request to join if able to travel to and from events.\n\nIf you are 40+ and looking for new friends and things to do why not give us a try?\n\nTheatre has always been a key aspect of our group and we have been to numerous performances over the years since the group started in June 2016. We have had some challenging times during the Covid Pandemic but we are now beginning to look at putting on more events as people begin to venture back out on the social scene.\n\nApart from Theatre our events can be anything from comedy nights, party breaks, quiz nights, outings, music nights, cinema, meals out, walks, guided tours, picnics, informal parties etc.\n\nThe extent and number of events will depend on what people are prepared to offer to the group. The organisers are not able to do everything so we are particularly interested in new members who are willing/able to host/organise events.\n\nWe appreciate not everyone is comfortable with uploading a face photo but this is preferred if possible as it does help with identification when meeting up for events (especially new people). However, if you prefer just add a photo of anything to get through the photo required section.\n\nAlso with new members there is an admin/joining fee required (currently £5 for individual membership or £10 for plus one membership) to go towards MeetUp fees.\n\nEncore: Theatre and Events for Friends to Enjoy is a Closed Group (acceptance for membership is at the discretion of organisers subject to availability). Please do not be offended should it not be possible to accept a request to join. This is more likely if you already belong to 10 or more other MeetUps as we are looking for active members and if you already belong to loads of other groups that's unlikely. If accepted you will need to attend at least one event every year (but hopefully you will want to join us at many more that). Current members can also recommend people to join the group.\n \nWe hope you will enjoy being a part of Encore and if you have an idea for a show or event please let me know and we will investigate, or better still have a go and organise it yourself as it will be possible to add extra organisers to Meetup.",

Friends, collaborators, romantic partners....There is potential for all types of healthy connection, because...\n\n***Through Deep Connection, Anything Is Possible!***\n\nWhen we interact without bias or neediness, we open the door to all possibilities. You'll have the opportunity to do that while learning how to connect far deeper than you may realise you are capable of.\n\nHere, we won't just talk, we get to the depths of our souls quickly. We connect while removing the crap that often gets in the way.\n\nJoin in with the interactive talks and workshops. You will learn, grow and connect. As the community grows there will be more immersive events and activities. The more you show up and interact, the more we will get happening.\n\nYou may recognise the name of this group. Deep Connections London is a group I originally created 6 years ago. I co-facilitated it with a friend for 2 years. We had over 3000 members and hosted around 400 events - Talks, workshops, all day challenges and retreats. It was THE place to connect deeply in the heart of London.\nI am proud of what we did, and of our members who kept showing up to further their journey into deeper connection.\n\nWe closed the group because our lives needed to go in different directions, but I never stopped missing our members or my events. I know that many will benefit from living a more deeply connected life..myself included... So, I'm bringing it back and expanding it throughout the UK and beyond.\n\nI can't wait to meet you and embark on this beautiful adventure!\n\n*With Passion, Purpose and Love*\n\n*David Saville*",

Most of the Events will include an evening meal, and breakfast and use of all Spa facilities we can use these times to meetup and talk and have a bit of fun , however it is solely up to the individual like I said no pressure. Treatments may be induced on some events.if not they can be booked at an extra cost.

So whether you need help using your gears effectively or want to train competitively and enter sportives with us, RPV is the group for YOU! </span></p><p><span>The ethos of the club is collaborative and considerate riding – the team is stronger than the individual. Have a look through our </span><a href=\"https://richmondparkvelo.com/club-ride-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">Club Ride Rules</a><span> to see what we aspire to. No one is perfect but we all share the aim to improve!</span></p><p><span>While some of the members race outside the club environment, we discourage racing on club rides where the stronger riders are expected to help the less strong ones by doing more work at the front rather than riding “off the front”. We regroup after hills and stop for mechanicals and punctures.</span></p><p><span>Members are given a ranking – Steady/Steady+/Intermediate/Intermediate+/Advanced to ensure that the riders in each group on a club ride are, so far as possible, of the same standard. Click here for more information on our </span><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Richmond-Park-Velo-cycling-club/pages/24915364/WHAT_DOES_MY_RANKING_MEAN/\" target=\"_blank\">ranking system</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>All our ride leaders ascribe to the same values of collaborative and considerate riding and offer constructive criticism and encouragement.

We ask all members to wear at least a club jersey on club rides.</span></p><p><span>So, what’s in it for you? Loads! </span></p><p><span>We give beginners tips to on how to ride efficiently and improve their hill-climbing and help intermediate cyclists move up to the next level by developing their group riding skills ie. their ability to ride collaboratively as a team. </span></p><p><span>We hold regular Skills Sessions where you can learn drafting and communication skills in a safe environment. </span></p><p><span>We organise cycle rides along many different routes in Surrey, Kent, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. </span></p><p><span>See what weekly rides and other events we offer here: </span><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Richmond-Park-Velo-cycling-club/events/calendar\" target=\"_blank\">Calendar</a></p><p><span>Sunday Club rides are typically 50 miles for Steadies; 50 to 60 miles for Inters and 60 to 70 miles for Inter+ and Advanced. All our club rides involve a break at the half way point for a coffee and a sandwich. Many of the members will stay around for “recovery ales” after the ride in a pub by the river in Kingston. </span></p><p><span>So, whatever your cycling goals, come, make friends and spin your wheels with Richmond Park Velo! </span></p><p><span>I hope to meet you soon! </span></p><p><span>Richard</span></p><p><span>(Organiser)</span></p>",

This ensures we cover a diverse range of vocabulary and you get to speak to as many people as possible, making the best use of your time here!\n\n**FAQs:**\n**1\\. Are the sessions suitable for Beginners?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so beginners will at least learn the short answers to questions like: 'what's your favorite food and where can I get it?' 'Chinese food at China Town!' From then, you can slowly build up your repertoire.\n\n**2\\. Are the sessions suitable for intermediate/advanced speakers?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so no matter what level you are at, you will be able to practice it to your level.\n\n**3\\. Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?**\nNo, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for at least half the session with our 'Speed-chatting' format!\n\n**About the host**\nChina Unbound hosts this meetup. We are a Chinese language school specialised in teaching adults. Over the past 7 years, we have helped many professionals and businesses learn Chinese with ease and fun.

More GMs means more players, more games, and a chance for the resident/forever GMs to take a break if needed.\n* Everyone can GM, even if you have never done it before. If you want to give it a try, this is your chance to do so in a safe space and with the additional benefit of having several GMs around who can provide assistance if needed.\n* Any new GM can run One-Shots, short adventures, long campaigns or anything else in between, there is no restrictions on that, as long as all the players are having fun and feel comfortable.\n* If you are interested in taking up the proverbial mantle of the GM, please send a PM on Meetup to one of the organisers, so that we can get you setup properly and notify the rest of the group.\n\nIf you have any question, request or inquiry, please feel free to drop a comment here or to message one of the organisers.\n\nSee you at the next event and, until then, may you roll a streak of Nat20s!",

It’s for people who’d like to take part in social activities on a regular basis, meet new friends and lead an active social life.</p> \n<p>We aim to discover unique and unusual local activities and events, together with regular, more traditional Meetups like pub nights, meals, cinema/theatre, live music, semi-guided walks etc. Our aim is to compliment activities to your own social calendars. </p> \n<p>We welcome new ideas and always encourage members to share with us your thoughts for future events.</p> \n<p>Most events will be free however occasionally we may suggest members make a voluntary (not mandatory) small contribution (for example £1 on a walk) to help cover the cost of having this group on the Meetup site. (Sadly it’s not a free service to the Organisers!)</p> \n<p>In addition, we ask that all members keep in mind the fact that our Event Organisers are hosting their events completely voluntarily, in their own time and we need to make the events as straightforward as possible for them to run. The absolute basic requirement of all members is therefore to ensure that you keep your RSVPs up to date. If you put your name down to attend an event and later cannot make it, you need to be fair to all parties involved and click on ‘Edit your RSVP’ to ‘Not going’ ahead of the event. Try not to leave it to the last minute if possible as there will quite often be people on a waiting list wanting to go, should a place become available.</p> \n<p>The most important thing about this group is to feel safe, relaxed, included and above all, have fun 😇</p> \n<p>Risk Disclaimer:<br>Please note that all members take part in all activities solely at their own risk, should any personal loss, accident, illness or physical injury occur during an event.</p>",

I have made a decision that every year the group will focus on a different way to explore our beautiful city and connect to likeminded people.\n\nFollowing the last 2 years of Covid and restrictions, it is only natural that we now all value the simpler things in life we might have taken for granted before, more deeply.\n\nI am inviting you to see your life, your world with new eyes....\nI am inviting you to become an explorer in your own city.\nAn explorer in the world.\nAn explorer with yourself and others.\nI invite you to awaken awe and playfulness and see what happens....\n\nWhether you have just moved to London or have lived here all your life, or if you live outside of London but always wanted to explore the forgotten or hidden parts of London, while meeting new people then this invitation is for you, if deep down inside you have an adventurer and explorer waiting to come out! All adults are welcome.\n\nI will be running a variety of events: my aim is to put events together that will unite people to come together in this amazing city (and sometimes even venture further afield!) and just have fun. And in the process slow down to really take in the beauty that is life and make magic moments. \n\n\n\n\n**IS THIS GROUP FOR YOU?**\nThis is for you if you are an adventurer/explorer at heart, you are open to new experiences, curious, energetic and enthusiastic about life and living in London and interested in exploring it in different ways. For me the lure of setting up this group wasn't just about getting out the house to see the city I have lived in for so many years but rather to explore London, in a new and exciting way! And it goes much deeper than that: it's about creating a sense of novelty, awe and wonder about our lives and our surroundings. For all we think we know so well and there's nothing left to discover, once we decide we are at heart \"intrepid explorers\" in our own lives and in our own city then we can choose to see everything around us with curiosity and fresh eyes and a renewed sense of wonder. It's an almost child like ability of playfulness, that we tend to lose as we become adults. This is what I hope to achieve with this group: recapture our sense of playfulness, discovery and wonder, while making connections with others! The magical moments happen when we are brave enough to explore and then make a connection with others on the same path!\n\n**MY EXPERIENCE:**\nI spent years working in top 5 star hotels as a Concierge so I got to know all the secret places that few people know about in London. In addition to that I have a passion for London and it's unique character and all the gems it hides in plain sight!I have escorted some friends and even business clients through London and they all loved how they were shown parts of London they didn't expect to see, and how much they enjoyed it! I am now also a Life Coach and Healer, so I love the idea of connecting people especially now following an extended period of Covid that will have affected our mental health and ability to connect with others. \n\nPlease feel free to drop me a line and suggest any events/activities you would like to take part in...all suggestions are welcome!",

Whatever your level of experience or how long you’ve been using the products, you’re welcome to our meetings!\n\n### Topics\n\nThe user group meetings cover all topics under the Dynamics 365 and Power Platform umbrella. We have talks on technical subjects such as development and solution architecture but also cover business perspectives as well, such as user adoption, managing change and business analysis.\n\n### National user group\n\nOur flagship user group – what we call the National user group – runs several events per year. These last all day, have over 15 sessions and typically attract an audience of over of over one hundred people. The events are held at Microsoft’s offices in Reading or London.\n\n### Regional user groups\n\nOur regional user groups cover many areas of the UK.

My introduction to board games and TTRPGs began with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, and Talisman. My journey as a nerd continued with games on the original PlayStation, Diablo, Final Fantasy, and Tomb Raider. Then my brother introduced me to novels by Terry Pratchett, the Redwall series, and the Earthsea Quartet by Ursual K. Le Guin. I also dabbled with Warhammer.

Whether you are single, partnered or polyamorous there is something for everyone! We don't believe in gender stereotypes (such as masc/fem) or slut-shaming or body-shaming. We are all 'good gays' just maybe some are more shy or socially anxious than others.</p><p>All Meetups are organised by a friendly host whose prime responsibility is to ensure all new members are welcomed, introduced to the group and not excluded. We have very quickly built a great reputation for making everyone feel comfortable and welcome.</p><p>We don’t believe in boxes, labels or tribes - we are all QUEER! We welcome all MSM (men who have sex with men) regardless of where you belong on the GBTQ+ spectrum.

So let’s go out and do more things that make you forget to check your phone!</p><p>We believe in disconnecting (at least temporarily!) from our mobile-enabled, click-bait geo-social networks and reconnecting in a meaningful way through face-to-face socialising instead. After all, we live in our brilliant London culture bubble, where we're used to having access to the crème de la crème of entertainment every night of the week, so let's take advantage of it!</p><p>We organise Meetup events of all kinds such as art galleries, cabaret, cinema, comedy, dance, museums, music concerts, spoken word poetry and theatre - as well as clubbing nights, cruising bars, drag shows and even sex parties!</p><p>A typical weekend's activities might look like this:</p><p>Friday: WYBTD Social in a private members club in Soho</p><p>Saturday: Art gallery in the afternoon. Off-West End play or independent cinema in the evening, followed by Clubbing</p><p>Sunday: Brunch, comedy cabaret afternoon at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern followed by Horse Meat Disco at the Eagle.</p><p>So regardless of whether you prefer Hard On or Kylie (or both at the same time!) join one of the most all inclusive Meetup groups for gay men.</p><p>Here is an article about WYBTD published recently by Gay Star News:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/will-you-darling-meetup-london/#gs.972e1z\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/will-you-darling-meetup-london/#gs.972e1z</a></p><p>Here is a discussion thread for members to write some short comments about their first time experiences with WYBTD: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/discussions/5665472998014976/chat/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/discussions/5665472998014976/chat/</a></p><p>If you need to know more - check out the testimonials on the 'group reviews' section here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/about/comments/?op=all\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.meetup.com/WYBTD-Will-You-Be-There-Darling/about/comments/?op=all</a></p><p>WYBTD's founder and main host, Michael, is a veteran of over 1,700 Meetup events!

Golf events are generally held in east Berkshire or north west Surrey, whilst other activities are mostly held in Ascot, Sunningdale or Windlesham.\n\nWomen and men of any age are welcome at our events (see also ' more details' below). Having fun doing sports or activities, whilst perhaps making some friends are the main aims of the group. Please ensure you have a photo of yourself when joining so that we can recognise you and welcome you when attending events (note: photos are only visible to members). Hope to see you soon!\n\nMore details:\n\n* Golf - organised most weekends (in Sunningdale, Ascot, or at one of several other nearby courses mainly in east Berkshire and north west Surrey) - usually over 18 holes (but at least once a month over nine). Further details lower down on this page.\n* Table tennis - at least once a month - for players of varied ability up to low league standard (though not suitable for complete beginners) - held at Charters leisure centre, Sunningdale\n* Snooker (or Pool) (at Lavender park, Ascot - during the week or at the weekend). Some experience needed for snooker.\n* Other sports/activities: Cycle rides (leisurely and on quiet roads or off-road) are organised occasionally (in Windlesham or Windsor Great park). Trips to watch sports or to play petanque may also be organised.\n* Please say on your profile which of our regular and occasional activities you are interested in! *Note: Badminton used to be organised (and coaching may still be available), but there is at least three other meetup groups in the area who regularly do this sport (plus some 'no strings badminton') further details available from Dave or David).*\n\n*• Note: If you are interested in bridge locally and online please go to: [https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/) .*\n\nThere are a roughly equal number of men and women in the group, and members are of various ages from 20's to over 60.\nTemporary local residents or visitors to the area from other parts or the country or from overseas are welcome to join if they regularly come to the area or before a visit.\n\\*If the group is 'full' there may be a delay in accepting you in to the group (but this will be done as soon as possible).\n\\*\\*If you are interested in organising a certain activity please contact Dave.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\\*\\*: Golf details: Events are organised at Courses\\* to suit experienced, intermediate and improver players mainly. Cost usually £25 to £40 (for 18 holes). The area has some attractive and quite challenging golf courses. Novice golfers are recommended to come to golf at Lavender Park, Blackwater Valley or Billingbear Park. Other courses that we go to are largely only suitable for more experienced players. The golf courses we visit often or sometimes are Sunningdale Heath, Billingbear Park, Chobham, Downshire, Lavender Park, Pine Ridge, Sand Martins, Mill Ride, Royal Ascot, Sherfield Oaks, Hennerton, Hoebridge, Theale, Sutton Green, Pyrford Lakes and Blackwater Valley.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nNotes:\n\\*: For 2022 there is a SMALL annual membership charge for active group members (at least), but there is no charge for your first event with the group (if done in the first two years of membership).\n\\*\\*: To keep the membership list up to date; because we have a maximum number of members, probably have a waiting list, and possibly to save money on meetup fees, a FEW/SOME inactive members only who have not paid the annual membership fee may be messaged to check they are still interested and active on Meetup (and if no response removed) or removed:\na) members who have not looked at our meetup site in their first 12 months of membership since the day they joined; or\nb) members who have been a member for less than two years, not looked at our meetup site for a year and who have not done any events; or\nc) members who have been a member for at least two years, who have not done any events, and who have not looked at our site for at least six months, or\nd) any member who has attended events before, who has not done any events in their last 3 years of membership and not looked at our meetup site for at least 12 months.\n*\\*\\*\\*Members removed can re-join on payment of the small membership fee. You can live a long way away, but please consider how busy you are on other activities and how far you live or work from the area and whether you will be able to attend events occasionally, before you re-join (note: we rarely do online events).*",

We rode about 8 miles along a flat tow path, we had a lovely day. Each Tuesday we met for our weekly spin but over the months, we found hills and the rides became longer, hybrids were exchanged for road bikes and Garmin was our new best friend.\nToday a pretty usual ride might be 50 miles with 2,500 ft Elevation gain - we have become very fit. There are lesser days though and still some off road where we enjoy the countryside and take things a little slower. We are a small and very friendly group and welcome new comers.\nHowever to continue with our \"happy Tuesday rides\" all new members must have a good level of fitness.\n\nJane",

Some events are Free Entry and some are paid gigs with a cheap Guest-List. It's a group for friends to meet people and organise nights out together :)\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nThe Live Music Industry is unfortunately not what it used to be 20 years ago - Nowadays, an Artist is judged on how many ‘Likes’ and ’Thumbs-Up’ they can get on a Facebook page…\n\nWe live in London the MUSIC CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\n\nIf you don’t believe that there are amazing nights of music playing all-night long, then you haven’t been paying attention.\n\nI am offering any Band or Artist currently performing around London an Instagram ‘Follow’ if they want it. I have lived here all my life and I know great music events happen everyday because I’ve been there, seen it and I am happy to support it. Last year has probably been the hardest for many Musicians - Nearly all the best Live Music Venues have closed down - BIG RED / LOCK TAVERN / THE MONARCH and many others. Most Alternative Music has been pushed to East LONDON and It's pretty hard getting gigs. So, I will be hosting a few MUSICIANS MEETUPS and I welcome anyone playing music or searching for fellow musicians to come down for a drink 🙂🍻\n\nOver the last 5 years of running this Group, I have had a lot of people come and express an interest in meeting other musicians to form bands. It’s difficult meeting the right people so if you are a Singer, Guitarist, Bassist or Drummer, have a band or think there’s anything we might be interested in then this might be a good group for you.\nWe put on our own nights and are always looking for great bands to see around London. If you are looking for Gigs or reliable promoters, then we can probably help point you in the right direction.\n\nAt the very least, we can talk music and then watch some bands :)\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nWe are not responsible for you or your belongings. By attending events you agree to waiver liability for the Host :) Please bring ID to all events 18+ Thank you",

We are a really friendly, welcoming bunch!\n\n\n\n\nWe have a great group of organisers, of varying ages, all of whom bring very different life experiences and perspectives to the mix.  In 2022 we are combining Sapphists Hertfordshire with Hitchin Sapphic Socials, and have added a mid Herts event organiser, so we hope you can find something for you not too far from home.  During the last couple of years, spurred on by the desire to address social isolation amongst our Herts LGBTQ+ community, we have enjoyed pub and meal nights, picnics, beach volleyball, book groups, walks, theatre trip, Hertfordshire Pride, North Herts Pride picnic etc.  Some great friendships have developed between some members, and we have been supportive just by being there for each other.\n\n\n\n\nWe hope that the group will grow and develop over time so please do chat to us about your ideas. If there is something you would like to see as part of this group then let us know.\n\n\n\n\nWe look forward to meeting you soon!\n\nEvent Organiser Jacqui - Living in Brighton for almost 15 years I always felt part of a community as LGBTQ+ is part of the fabric of the city. It felt different when I moved to Hitchin so I started a local group to help people feel connected to a wider community and have fun!\n\n\n\n\nGroup Organiser Gillian - After discovering I am lesbian in my 40s/50s, I met and married a woman and moved to another county.  Returning alone to Watford a few years ago, I began to realise I had absolutely no connection with women who love women here!  I joined Meetup and Facebook groups, have enjoyed some great events, and have made many valuable new friends.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Organiser Sharon - I joined the group to socialise with like minded people and have made some lovely new friends.  I’ve enjoyed various nights out with the Sapphists ladies, from meals out, karaoke, book clubs, music to Prides.  Lots of fun and laughter to be had.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Organiser Jenny - I realised I was gay later than most people my age and then felt like I was the only gay in the village.  It seemed like all Lesbian/Bi events were in London and there was nothing in the countryside.  Going to my first LGBTQ+ Meetup was a game changer for me and this group has played a wonderful part in my journey.  So for me helping organise events is my way of paying it forward.  You couldn’t ask for a nicer group of people.",

We promote being well and healthy through music and developing a small local community of budding musicians who are otherwise isolated and disconnected from growing with other musicians.\n\n2 hours long acoustic music sessions limited to a max of 8 musicians.

Folk:** we started off performing as folk musicians and love folk music by T Bone Burnett, Wovenhand, Jason Isbell and the Indigo Girls.

With over **44,000 members**, we have now **organised over 1,700 hiking trips** including day walks, weekend hiking trips and an increasing range of foreign hiking trips travelling to Europe and beyond for adventure travel holidays. We target ourselves at the 25 to 49 age group (or young at heart) and whilst most members are within this age group, we do welcome anyone over the age, as well as keeping fit hiking is a great way to make new like minded friends.\nBetween our 3 most senior hike leaders we have over 50 years of experience of leading hikes across the UK as well as an ever increasing range of international trips and tours. We have every corner of the UK covered from Snowdonia in Wales to the Lake District, the great Scottish Highlands and even the far off corners like Cornwall.\nPlease do take a look at our (over 400) independent group reviews:\n[http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all](http://www.meetup.com/Outdooraholics/about/comments/?op=all)\n\nWe have 47 different day and weekend trips that have all been pre hiked and meticulously planned. We organise all the logistics for our hiking trips so that you can just turn up, walk and have a great time and meet new people while enjoying the great outdoors.\n\nIf you enjoy hiking and are based in the UK and looking to meet new like minded friends, Outdooraholics is for you and we look forward to welcoming you to the group!\n\n**Who attends our events?**\nWe're mainly in our mid 20s to mid 40s, but age is no barrier as long as you are young at heart and over 18.\n\nMost of our members generally either live or work in London, although we have people from all over the UK attending and we've had several people visit from abroad for our trips and join us at our destination. After all you don't need to live in London to visit Cornwall, Wales or the Lake District!\n\nWe have a lot of international members - either here on work placements or to live and this brings a superb cultural variety and mix of life experiences to the group and helps to make our trips so interesting and diverse.\n\nWe get a lot of people who attend their first event on their own and we always go out of our way to make everyone very welcome on our trips. They have proven to be a great way to meet people and make new friends as well as to see this wonderful island\n\n**Can I really turn up alone?**\nYes of course - most people do! Please don't be nervous about attending your first event - we have all been in the same boat at some point of turning up at an event alone and knowing nobody. To help introduce people to the group and indeed hiking we have designed 27 different hiking day trips which are a superb way to come and meet the group and we can assure you of a very warm welcome whatever event you choose and there are bound to be others who are attending their first event too. Hiking is a great way of meeting like minded people and making new friendships whilst keeping fit and seeing wonderful places too.\nIf you are nervous about committing to a weekend trip, please don't be, almost everyone has turned up to an event before without knowing anyone and we all know what it's like. To help new members into the group we run 4 to 6 day trips a month which are an easy and low cost way to try our events.\n\n**What hiking trips do we organise?**\n**Day hikes**\nWe organise typically 6 to 8 day hiking trips a month and have 27 tried and tested routes that we use from London. All are pre walked and are picturesque routes that we carefully choose. All trips leave from a central London station and we arrange train tickets, so you can just turn up and enjoy a great day out with us.\n\n**Weekend hiking trips**\nWe organise 3 to 6 weekend trips a month to all corners of the UK, showing you the very best that this country has to offer. We typically rent an entire Youth Hostel just for our group and after a great days hiking then either go to a local restaurant or cook at the hostel. We have over 18 different weekend trips and are adding new ones all the time!\nWe have a professionally trained chef who joins many of our trips and we regularly visit all of the UK's National Parks and designated \"Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\"\n\n**Trips abroad**\nWe offer an ever increasing variety of trips from 3 nights up to a week and will be having a number of new trips added in 2022. Where possible we aim for twin bed rooms and put the meticulous planning into our foreign trips so that you can have a great time and get to see the best of the area that you're visiting. It is a legal requirement (as well as advisable for safety) in many foreign mountainous locations to have an internationally qualified guide and for many of our foreign trips we have a local or native speaking guide.\n\nWhat else do we organise?\n\n**Socials**\nAs well as walking trips, we organise several pub socials per year in central London locations as well as discount nights at outdoor stores in central London.\nWe do focus on the outdoor events more than socials but we can recommend a good social group who do the following events:\nPub crawls, social events, wine tastings, sightseeing, making new friends, dining adventure, new in town drinks, food and cooking related events, exploring London's night life, social drinks, 18s, Go Ape, Treasure Hunts, Go Karting and Paintball\n\n**Outdoor activities**\nWe've been offering multi activity weekends for several years and have both offered or will be bringing the following activities to our weekends - some in London and some that we have to travel to:\nSky diving, coasteering, camping, canoeing and hiking weekends, horse riding, paragliding, parachute jumping, pot holing, yoga breaks, fitness weekends, SCUBA, travel, sightseeing, travelling abroad, indoor and outdoor rock climbing, skydiving, cycling, trekking, backpacking, yoga breaks and tours, holiday getaway breaks, travelling, adventure weekends, sailing, coast walking, long distance walking, caving, fitness weekends, hiking abroad, rock climbing, Go Ape, zip wires, navigation training, historic sightseeing, countryside conservation, overseas trips, the 3 (three) peaks challenge, tennis, hiking and abseiling, go karting, exercise and activity weekends for hikers, treasure hunts, paintball, photograpy exhibitions, treasure and scavenger hunts around London, Paint-ball, charity trips and charity adventure nights with Hope for Homes, badminton, squash, recreation weekends, gorge walking, navigation courses, culture trips, community trips, sea kayaking, kayaking along the Thames, via ferrata walks, orienteering, sailing, exercise boot camps, target shooting and clay pigeon shooting, shopping discount evenings at Cotswold Outdoors.

We take your safety and the great reputation of our yoga/hiking trips very seriously and we only ever use professional full time yoga instructors. We also typically have a professional chef to ensure we have wonderful, healthy and revitalising food. We follow the same great formula as with our hiking weekends - great organisation, great home cooked food, pre planned and hiked routes and highly experienced hike leaders and using hostels allows us to do this at a great price too. We look forward to bringing you an even more expanded range of Yogaholics trips as we enter our 4th year of these Yogaholics trips in 2015!\nWe have created a great range of hostel based yoga trips on this wonderful concept, but if you would like more luxury hiking/yoga trips also run by a professional yoga instructor, we can highly recommend the excellent Yoga Trails\n\n**Why Outdooraholics?**\nA very good question. There are some superb London based walking groups on Meetup - Backabush are well known for over a decade of organising superb hiking weekends and brought the whole concept of great value hiking trips to Meetup and Trailblazer have been organising an excellent and huge range of days hikes for over 5 years now. Both groups we highly recommend and regularly hear great things about their trips and both have inspired many other groups to offer similar events to theirs. 1000 Foot Hiking club is also highly recommended - run by some inspirational people on a non profit basis with all money raised going to a water aid charity.\nExcept for Outdooraholics most of the major London hiking groups on Meetup have evolved out of Backabush and Trailblazer and generally run the same format as their trips. Whilst we'd be lying if we said we weren't inspired by the great trips these groups run, we wanted to do something different and new and created Outdooraholics from scratch and we believe giving our trips a quite different flavour. We get you out of London on aaa rated trips. We took a very simple idea as our basis - of organising all of the logistics for our hiking trips so that you don't have to. We advise you what to bring, you turn up and you'll have a great time. All of our trips are run by trip leaders from that particular country so we believe they can show you the country and culture like only a local can. We organise an equal mix of day hikes and weekend trips and put the same detailed planning into both.\nWe also try to use local tour guides for the majority of our trips so that you can get a proper insight in to the history, culture and country that you're visiting - after all you wouldn't expect to visit Russia for example and be \"shown\" the country and it's cultures by a British person!\nWe plan all of our trips in advance including the routes that we take to ensure that we show you the best of an area and also that we know what the risks are on the tracks and indeed that the trails are passable and safe. All of the photos on our trips are taken by one of our hike leaders, from that trip, on the paths that you will actually be hiking so that you can best decide which trips appeal to you. The great outdoors does carry risks which is why we pre walk and plan all of our routes and trips.\nWe believe we offer the most diverse range of both day hikes and weekend trips available in the UK.\nWe only offer superb trips and we even have a professional chef who joins us on many of our weekend trips to offer great food, which is much appreciated after a tough days hiking.\n\n**Safety**\nOur main hike leader has undertaken both a four day [Walk Group Leader](http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/walking-group-leader-award) course accredited by the MLT (Mountain Leader Training) and a six day [Mountain Leader](http://www.mountain-training.org/award-schemes/mountain-leader-award) course (also accredited by the MLT) as well as having a two day outdoor Activity First Aid course and over 20 years of extensive and diverse hiking and leading experience. All of our trips are run by very experienced hikers with Outdoor Activity First Aid qualifications and most of our trip leaders are a minimum of Mountain Leader trained with 2 of our trip leaders having a military background. Sadly the outdoors always presents risks but through our experience, training and careful planning as well as pre planning and walking all of our routes we do our best to minimise those.\n\n**Further information**\nYou can email us at: info@outdooraholics.co.uk\nOr you can follow us and our hiking adventures on Facebook:\n[http://www.facebook.com/outdooraholics](http://www.facebook.com/outdooraholics)\nWe sincerely look forward to meeting you at one of our weekend or hiking day trip adventures soon and can ensure a warm welcome from the Outdooraholics team to you\n\n**Joining the Team**\nWe are looking for experienced hike leaders (ideally with at least Mountain Leader level training) and whilst we demand a lot from people, working with the largest hiking group in London and one of the largest in Europe brings a lot of advantages too. Safety and enjoyment of people attending our trips is paramount. You don't have to be based in the South East or London as we have a demand for people in all locations. If you share these values, please email us for more details along with a summary of your experience: info@outdooraholics.co.uk",

Lucy and Isabelle co-founded Divorce Club back in 2016 for one simple reason – we know that no one should go through divorce alone! It's now the largest Divorce Club in the UK.**\n\nYou may be feeling lonely, unsupported or simply looking for friendly help & advice in order to move on. Afterall, what other life event can uproot you from your home, shake your financial security, reduce your time with your children and make friends and family disappear overnight? Sometimes you don’t know where to turn, or just feel angry or sad.\n\nThat’s where we at Divorce Club London can help.\n\nWe know it can be really tough going through a divorce. It’s hard to find people who know how you feel unless they’ve been through it. Divorce Club London is hosted by people who have been through a divorce and who know exactly what you’re going through (whatsmore our co-founder Isabelle is a clinical psychologist). So we know that the best remedy for the pain of divorce is to meet others in the same boat and make a fresh start. We also know that trying to navigate the legal and financial side is an additional pressure, just when you’re at your lowest ebb.\n\nDivorce Club London connects people to every single resource they may need to get through a divorce from the moment of separation to moving on and meeting someone new. We aim to reduce the sense of isolation and overwhelm in the first stage of separation but also look to help people identify how to look forward and rebuild their lives. We fundamentally believe out of the ashes of the end of a relationship, new beginnings and a huge opportunity for growth arise.\n\nFor newly separated people we offer advice and help on the process and emotional overwhelm. As people go through the process they have continuous access to legal and financial advice while also being able to tap into a community of people who can share the roller coaster of milestones, difficulties and triumphs. And for those in the later stages we offer coaching for goal setting, and online sessions for moving on, dating and growth.\n\nDivorce Club London provides expert information that takes the mystery and fear out of divorce. We have guest speakers from top law firms, mediators, psychologists, parenting experts, divorce coaches, financial advisors, dating experts and many more - advice that usually costs a lot of money!\n\nFor less than the price of a weekly takeout coffee, you can join us and meet other people who know exactly what you’re going through.\n\nMembership includes access to:\n\n* Weekly social zoom calls\n* Legal Q&As with respected family lawyers\n* Financial Q&As\n* Parenting sessions\n* Goal setting\n* Book clubs\n* Divorce orientated workshops\n* Access to a 24/7 community messaging channel\n* In real life meetups and socials\n\nFor just £7.99 a month, you can get inclusive access to all of our events, access to chat in our private community, and a service which aims to match you with friends. We even give you the first month for free.\nWhatsmore, we host a free Meetup group session once a month so you can come and see what Divorce Club is all about.\n\nSo we hope that you invest in giving yourself a better divorce, and a better recovery. We passionately believe that you can have an amazing life after divorce! There is such an opportunity for growth and many of our members have said how much happier they are two, three, four years down the line – so hang on in there. Start again, with us.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you!\nLucy Davis & Dr Isabelle Hung\n\n**[SIGN UP TO BE A MEMBER – FIRST MONTH FREE!](https://www.divorceclub.com/membership/)**\n\n**\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-**\n\n**Join Divorce Club**\n**Find out more at [Divorce Club](https://www.divorceclub.com/), and see our [membership options](https://www.divorceclub.com/membership/)**",

It is difficult when all of your friends are in couples and your attached friends cannot come out with you at the weekend to a singles event if they don't wish to cause problems in their relationships. Coming out alone is not easy so we put ladies in touch with each other so they can have a chat before coming to an event together.\nI should add that this is what we do for our events with Contact Singles.

For this reason we've decided to start organising drinks for young professionals, intended for those who love to have a drink with like-minded people after a busy day of work. Do spread the word, and bring friends, colleagues and family!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ:\n\n\n\n\n❓It's my first time and I'm coming alone, should I be nervous?\nNo, you found the right event! Almost everyone joins these drinks alone and there are always a bunch of first timers. Just grab a drink and say hi to those around the reserved tables and you'll be absolutely fine :)\n\n\n\n\n❓I cannot make it at 7pm, can I come later?\nYes, definitely! There will always be one of the organisers present from 7pm onwards, but most people just join whenever they can. There is no official 'start' so to say, and it usually stays busy till around 10pm-11pm. For first timers it can be easier to mingle if you come before 8pm, when it's not that busy yet.\n\n\n\n\n❓How often are the drinks and where are they held?\nWe have drinks every two weeks from 7pm in the Yard bar in Soho. Sometimes we organise other events such as pub crawls and picnics. Just keep an eye on the Meetup page.\n\n\n\n\n❓Is there a dress code?\nNope, not at all. Just wear whatever you want.\n\n\n\n\n❓Is there a cost?\nOnly for whatever drinks you buy at the bar.\n\n\n\n\n❓What's the age profile?\nMost people who attend range from their early twenties to their early thirties.\n\n\n\n\n❓Are the Tuesday drinks for networking?\nNo, the drinks are super casual, and and not intended to find your new dream job. We have people from all different professional backgrounds, so it's always cool to hear what others are up to.\n\n\n\n\n❓I don't drink alcohol, can I come?\nOf course! Since it's on a Tuesday many take it easy, so you won't be an outlier.\n\n\n\n\nA note on behaviour:\nThis Meetup attracts a diverse group of people of all different backgrounds, personalities, and opinions. We aim to provide a safe space for people of all backgrounds, gender identities, and ethnicities. Whilst similarities and differences in both opinions and personalities are inevitable, we will not tolerate racism, bullying, and/or discrimination. ",

It can be tough enough ‘coming out’, but being introverted can make it even more of a challenge and sometimes you need a gentle push.\n\nSo, whether you consider yourself to be ‘gay’, ‘bi’, ‘bi-curious’, ‘pansexual’ or any other label; whether you are ‘in the closet’, ‘out’ or in the process of ‘coming out’; whether you are vulnerable or feel at risk, this group brings us together. We embrace those who have experienced depression, anxiety, loneliness or isolation, especially if you may be considered on the spectrums of ADHD, Autism & Asperger’s, Bipolar, OCD and/or Schizophrenia.\n\nYou may be a highly sensitive person who experiences intense highs and lows to an extreme degree. You may be an artistic Creative with a vivid inner world hidden and locked away. You may feel easily overwhelmed by large groups of people, unsettled by the turbulence of the LGBTQ+ dating scene or sidelined/neglected in a whirlwind of rapidly spinning social circles. Anxiety may have even prevented you from moving forwards in friendships and relationships with other people because you are afraid of either hurting or getting hurt. This Meetup group is designed for you!\n\nHave you ever taken years to build up the confidence to attend an event only to be disappointed? Want to attend an LGBTQ+ event but held back by your shyness? Simply come as you are. There is no need to pretend anymore. This is a get together for people who do not want to be alone, to feel comfortable, and foster a nice, friendly circle of people. And if you would like to attend but do not feel like talking much, then that is cool, too! Take it at your own pace.\n\n===\nDETAILS\n\nThis free group is for friendship and dating, designed to reach out to others and create mutual support. The concept is simple: helping one another get out there in the world. Some meet-ups are limited to 6 or 12 places so that it is not too overwhelming for new members. I will provide my contact details 24 hours before each event either in a group e-mail or in a private message. Do feel free to get in touch if you would like to have a chat about the event before you attend!\n\nI do not charge fees for attending our meet-ups. All I ask is that a one-off discretionary donation is made for your first time. This is to help cover the cost of running the group. Meetup groups are not free to run and cost £180 over the course of a year. I have put a link below (Paypal) where you give a one-off donation of £10 (or any amount) to help out. The group will always remain free so there is no obligation but it would be greatly appreciated. The link works on both desktops and smartphones.\n\n[paypal.me/roryduffy27 ](paypal.me/roryduffy27 )\n\nFacebook:\n[https://www.facebook.com/groups/shybisandgayguys](https://www.facebook.com/groups/shybisandgayguys)",

Showing up is a commitment we want everyone to make, as this helps the organisers maximise the spaces booked, helps the attendees meet more new people, and most importantly it help you fulfil the commitment you made to yourself to meet nice new friends.</p><p><br /></p><p>WE STRICTLY DO NOT DO ANY NETWORING OR ANY BUSINESS-RELATED EVENTS OF ANY KIND, NO EXCEPTIONS. This group is for meaningful friendships and quality time amongst women in London.</p><p><br /></p><p>NO-SHOW POLICY – We would like to maximise every event for your full enjoyment, therefore we encourage you to turn up to the events you RSVP to. All attendance is monitored. TWO missed events will be marked as 'no-shows', and a polite reminder will be sent to you. If you do not show up THREE times when you have RSVP'd as \"Yes\" without sending a message and changing your RSVP, you will be automatically removed from the group. Its important you RSVP to things you can attend to, and change you RSVP in good time if other plans come up. Please do this so we can offer your spot to someone else if you decide not to attend. This rule applies to last minute drop outs (UNDER 48hrs) without a message too. This is to make sure that we maximise all the space we book for events and include more people who want to participate and enjoy meeting each other.</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>PAYMENT - Please note, running this group is not free and lead organisers pay Meet-up a monthly fee to keep the group running. Therefore RSVPs will be charged a non-refundable £3 for all events. Some events might also require an additional fee if the restaurant or event venue requires a prepayment. This £3 is non-refundable under all circumstances unless only if the organisers cancel the event. If you cancel your RSVP the non-refund still applies. If you would like to support the continued running of this group you can also donate any amount to our PayPal pool which I can send to you if you request the link :)</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>WAITLIST - Please be aware that we currently don't have waitlist and all events are first come first serve. Updates will be sent out once we can have a functioning waitlist.</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>SAFETY AND COURTESY: We want everyone to have a fun and safe time when attending our events, and we want our organisers to communicate with attendees about event  updates with confidence that they will be treated with respect - therefore we follow Meet-up's policy on safety strictly.  We do not tolerate any abusive language towards anyone in this group. Please DM people with respect. Any members found to be harassing/insulting/threatening/bullying any member of this group will be removed immediately and the ban will be permanent. We also make reports to meet-up who have the power to remove any policy breakers of the platform completely.</p><p><br /></p><p>SOCIAL MEDIA: Our Instagram handle is @femalefriendsLDN. Please follow.

        "description": "Ever wanted to try bouldering/indoor wall climbing? It is an exciting and fun way to stay fit: it is challenging, both physically and mentally, and a great way to exercise! I remember walking pass the Arch at Bermondsey and wondering “where on earth are those people walking to, especially with those funny shoes hanging from their backpacks” before I knew it I was one of those people! lol\n\nI plan to have weekly bouldering Meet-ups for people who are curious about bouldering or like bouldering and want to have some good company and vibes while at it. We can cheer each other on and work on problems together!\n\nAll levels are welcome! Even if you are a complete beginner, though kindly please watch the safety intro video ([The Arch Climbing Wall - Safety Intro ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBTStDqP_9c)) and fill out the [register online form here ](https://signups.archclimbingwall.com/)\\- please make sure to watch the video all the way through as there is important info in it that you’ll be asked a few questions about on your very first visit to the Arch centre\\. Nevertheless\\, you will have your fellow Bermondsey Boulders to support you on your very first climb and future climbs :\\-\\)\n\nI am sure the intermediate and advance climbers will be happy to share some tips when you attend, I know I will need it lol. Let’s get to know each other and help each other out to make this group a positive and fulfilling experience for everyone.\n\nTwice a week, from 6:30pm on Wednesday and 11:00am on Sundays we will be meeting at the Surrey Quays Arch & Bermondsey Arch. Let us enjoy bouldering together. The entrance is within the biscuit factory compound that also has the PureGym Bermondsey branch. For the Surrey Quays centre, you can't miss it just go to the Shopping centre entrance and it will be on your left.\n\nAll you need to bring are a comfortable change of clothes that are easy to move in. The Arch provides lockers to keep your personal belongings safe as well.\n\nThe Surrey Quays branch is now completed this new Rotherhithe SE16 branch is located in the heart of the biggest Shopping Complex in the Borough, so cool right? And do not worry, it is literally the same distance you will travel from Bermondsey Station to Arch one. \n\nAfter the Sunday session, let us have lunch together at the famous Bermondsey Maltby Street Market..it is a 15 minute walk from the Arch.…. They have a good variety of cooked food to buy.. yum!\n\nThis event is completely free to attend, and the only costs you have to bear are the Arch fees and/or shoe rental.\n\nIndoor bouldering is safe (if you follow the guidelines) and offers a great workout, no matter what your age! So if you have ever been curious about the sport of bouldering, or wanting to get back into it with some company this group is a great place to start in what I hope will be a safe and friendly atmosphere for you. Check out some of our session's highlights here - https://www.meetup.com/bermondsey-boulders/photos/\n\nThe bouldering sessions will be taking place in the Arch centres (bouldering only) in SE16. These are located in the neighbouring districts of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe (Southwark is so bless)\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to DM me! Let’s enjoy bouldering together and make new friends along the way !\n\n[Event Summary]\n\nLocations: Arch Climbing Wall: Building One, Bermondsey SE16 (10min from Bermondsey Station)\n                  Arch Climbing Wall, Surrey Quays, Rotherhithe SE16 (10min from Canada Water Station & Surrey Quays Overground Station)\n\nDate & Time: Twice a week,\n6:30pm - 9:30pm (Can join and leave anytime, Wednesdays)\n                                             11:00am - 13:00pm (Lunch afterwards at Maltby Street Market, Sundays)\n\nLevel: Beginners are welcome!

To help bring people together to play board games across London.\n\nThe main difference between this Meetup and some others is that you are very much encouraged to come with your own suggestions for venues, dates and times for game sessions. This Meetup will then allow you to host and organise it. If you'd like to host an event, simply write that in the discussion and you will be made an event organiser.\n\nThere are no rules on which games you can or cannot play. This is simply up to the group to decide, perhaps in advance by making the event a game-specific event, or by mutual agreement.\n\nPlease do join and let's start organising more board game sessions all across London!\n\nFor example, perhaps you have a local gaming cafe but no-one to play with, then simply post a date and time and a limit of how many players the game(s) you want to play suits and see if anyone signs up. The more we do that, the bigger this group will grow.",

We will be looking for new, committed hosts with fresh ideas, too, to help our local group grow and develop, offering a range of regular and new events to suit the different interests and tastes of our members. Some events will have a small cost so that the organisers can cover the subscription fees, but many events will remain free of charge.
