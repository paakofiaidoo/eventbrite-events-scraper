This gives you an easy and convenient way to meet new people in a way that completely dissolves barriers. This is NOT speed dating and so you will be meeting both ladies and gentlemen in mixed groups. The intent is to create friendships.\n\nOne of the greatest benefits is that this tears down the walls of shyness. Many people have deep-seated anxiety when it comes to talking to people they don‚Äôt know. But when you push outside your comfort zones, this speedy connection opens up the door to allow you to easily communicate and work together with other members of the group.\n\nSpeed friending allows you to identify other people with common interests. The conversations that take place don‚Äôt have to be deep, profound or even scripted; simply discussing likes and dislikes may lead to future friendships. Often, people want to make new friends, but they aren‚Äôt quite sure how to go about it.

This is a community for Chinese and English learners of all levels to learn from one another in a relaxed social environment. Our goals are to have fun, improve language skills through conversation and build a community for Chinese and English learners.\n\n**Why are we different?**\n\n* Structured time to maximise learning\n* Facilitated conversations\n* Help on hand\n\n**Who is it for?**\n\n* Anyone learning Chinese who would like to improve and practice with native speakers\n* Chinese speakers looking to improve their English skills with native speakers\n* Learners of all levels\n\n**Format- Speed-chatting!**\n\n* We will pair you up with a native speaker of your target language.\n* We will provide fun, engaging topics to prompt your chat.\n* Every 30 minutes we rotate with different people. This ensures we cover a diverse range of vocabulary and you get to speak to as many people as possible, making the best use of your time here!\n\n**FAQs:**\n**1\\. Are the sessions suitable for Beginners?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so beginners will at least learn the short answers to questions like: 'what's your favorite food and where can I get it?' 'Chinese food at China Town!' From then, you can slowly build up your repertoire.\n\n**2\\. Are the sessions suitable for intermediate/advanced speakers?**\nYes, the way we set up the questions allows you to answer the questions as long or as short as you like, so no matter what level you are at, you will be able to practice it to your level.\n\n**3\\. Would I end up speaking English all the time and get nothing out of this?**\nNo, because it is compulsory for everyone to communicate in Chinese for at least half the session with our 'Speed-chatting' format!\n\n**About the host**\nChina Unbound hosts this meetup. We are a Chinese language school specialised in teaching adults. Over the past 7 years, we have helped many professionals and businesses learn Chinese with ease and fun.

We are a friendly active group mainly for people interested in golf, snooker, table tennis, and occasionally a few other sports/activities (e.g. cycling). Golf events are generally held in east Berkshire or north west Surrey, whilst other activities are mostly held in Ascot, Sunningdale or Windlesham.\n\nWomen and men of any age are welcome at our events (see also ' more details' below). Having fun doing sports or activities, whilst perhaps making some friends are the main aims of the group. Please ensure you have a photo of yourself when joining so that we can recognise you and welcome you when attending events (note: photos are only visible to members). Hope to see you soon!\n\nMore details:\n\n* Golf - organised most weekends (in Sunningdale, Ascot, or at one of several other nearby courses mainly in east Berkshire and north west Surrey) - usually over 18 holes (but at least once a month over nine). Further details lower down on this page.\n* Table tennis - at least once a month - for players of varied ability up to low league standard (though not suitable for complete beginners) - held at Charters leisure centre, Sunningdale\n* Snooker (or Pool) (at Lavender park, Ascot - during the week or at the weekend). Some experience needed for snooker.\n* Other sports/activities: Cycle rides (leisurely and on quiet roads or off-road) are organised occasionally (in Windlesham or Windsor Great park). Trips to watch sports or to play petanque may also be organised.\n* Please say on your profile which of our regular and occasional activities you are interested in! *Note: Badminton used to be organised (and coaching may still be available), but there is at least three other meetup groups in the area who regularly do this sport (plus some 'no strings badminton') further details available from Dave or David).*\n\n*‚Ä¢¬†Note: If you are interested in bridge locally and online please go to:¬†[https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/](https://www.meetup.com/Ascot-Sunningdale-Bridge-Meetup/)¬†.*\n\nThere are a roughly equal number of men and women in the group, and members are of various ages from 20's to over 60.\nTemporary local residents or visitors to the area from other parts or the country or from overseas are welcome to join if they regularly come to the area or before a visit.\n\\*If the group is 'full' there may be a delay in accepting you in to the group (but this will be done as soon as possible).\n\\*\\*If you are interested in organising a certain activity please contact Dave.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\\*\\*: Golf details: Events are organised at Courses\\* to suit experienced, intermediate and improver players mainly. Cost usually ¬£25 to ¬£40 (for 18 holes). The area has some attractive and quite challenging golf courses. Novice golfers are recommended to come to golf at Lavender Park, Blackwater Valley or Billingbear Park. Other courses that we go to are largely only suitable for more experienced players. The golf courses we visit often or sometimes are Sunningdale Heath, Billingbear Park, Chobham, Downshire, Lavender Park, Pine Ridge, Sand Martins, Mill Ride, Royal Ascot, Sherfield Oaks, Hennerton, Hoebridge, Theale, Sutton Green, Pyrford Lakes and Blackwater Valley.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nNotes:\n\\*: For 2022 there is a SMALL annual membership charge for active group members (at least), but there is no charge for your first event with the group (if done in the first two years of membership).\n\\*\\*: To keep the membership list up to date; because we have a maximum number of members, probably have a waiting list, and possibly to save money on meetup fees, a FEW/SOME inactive members only who have not paid the annual membership fee may be messaged to check they are still interested and active on Meetup (and if no response removed) or removed:\na) members who have not looked at our meetup site in their first 12 months of membership since the day they joined; or\nb) members who have been a member for less than two years, not looked at our meetup site for a year and who have not done any events; or\nc) members who have been a member for at least two years, who have not done any events, and who have not looked at our site for at least six months, or\nd) any member who has attended events before, who has not done any events in their last 3 years of membership and not looked at our meetup site for at least 12 months.\n*\\*\\*\\*Members removed can re-join on payment of the small membership fee. You can live a long way away, but please consider how busy you are on other activities and how far you live or work from the area and whether you will be able to attend events occasionally, before you re-join (note: we rarely do online events).*","city":"Ascot","state":"03","country":"gb","isPrivate":true,"isNewGroup":false},{"id":"33142903","name":"Friendly Frolickers 50+ singles Meetup Group","link":"https://www.meetup.com/social-events-for-50-singles-meetup-group","description":"<p>This group is for over 50s singles to meet up, socialise and widen their social circle, in a fun, friendly and safe environment.&nbsp;We are looking for new members to join us, attend and host all kinds of events and holidays.</p><p><br /></p><p>Travel is my passion and although based in London, our events are not limited geographically.&nbsp;Holidays, travel and adventure are also planned in the UK and abroad.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you love travel or hope to travel in the future, enjoy socialising, making new friends, outdoor activities, cultural events, restaurants and gatherings or anything and everything that is better shared, then 'Friendly Frolickers' is the Meetup group for you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Whether you want to just socialise, have short breaks away or travel further afield, you can save money by sharing and make new friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is to plan and offer events at the most reasonable prices by researching and resourcing the best deals.</p><p><br /></p><p>Friendly Frolickers was initially set up as a WhatsApp group in July 2018 when a group of just 7 people were disillusioned with online dating.

Lucy and Isabelle co-founded Divorce Club back in 2016 for one simple reason ‚Äì we know that no one should go through divorce alone! It's now the largest Divorce Club in the UK.**\n\nYou may be feeling lonely, unsupported or simply looking for friendly help & advice in order to move on. Afterall, what other life event can uproot you from your home, shake your financial security, reduce your time with your children and make friends and family disappear overnight? Sometimes you don‚Äôt know where to turn, or just feel angry or sad.\n\nThat‚Äôs where we at Divorce Club London can help.\n\nWe know it can be really tough going through a divorce. It‚Äôs hard to find people who know how you feel unless they‚Äôve been through it. Divorce Club London is hosted by people who have been through a divorce and who know exactly what you‚Äôre going through (whatsmore our co-founder Isabelle is a clinical psychologist). So we know that the best remedy for the pain of divorce is to meet others in the same boat and make a fresh start. We also know that trying to navigate the legal and financial side is an additional pressure, just when you‚Äôre at your lowest ebb.\n\nDivorce Club London connects people to every single resource they may need to get through a divorce from the moment of separation to moving on and meeting someone new. We aim to reduce the sense of isolation and overwhelm in the first stage of separation but also look to help people identify how to look forward and rebuild their lives. We fundamentally believe out of the ashes of the end of a relationship, new beginnings and a huge opportunity for growth arise.\n\nFor newly separated people we offer advice and help on the process and emotional overwhelm. As people go through the process they have continuous access to legal and financial advice while also being able to tap into a community of people who can share the roller coaster of milestones, difficulties and triumphs. And for those in the later stages we offer coaching for goal setting, and online sessions for moving on, dating and growth.\n\nDivorce Club London provides expert information that takes the mystery and fear out of divorce. We have guest speakers from top law firms, mediators, psychologists, parenting experts, divorce coaches, financial advisors, dating experts and many more - advice that usually costs a lot of money!\n\nFor less than the price of a weekly takeout coffee, you can join us and meet other people who know exactly what you‚Äôre going through.\n\nMembership includes access to:\n\n* Weekly social zoom calls\n* Legal Q&As with respected family lawyers\n* Financial Q&As\n* Parenting sessions\n* Goal setting\n* Book clubs\n* Divorce orientated workshops\n* Access to a 24/7 community messaging channel\n* In real life meetups and socials\n\nFor just ¬£7.99 a month, you can get inclusive access to all of our events, access to chat in our private community, and a service which aims to match you with friends. We even give you the first month for free.\nWhatsmore, we host a free Meetup group session once a month so you can come and see what Divorce Club is all about.\n\nSo we hope that you invest in giving yourself a better divorce, and a better recovery. We passionately believe that you can have an amazing life after divorce! There is such an opportunity for growth and many of our members have said how much happier they are two, three, four years down the line ‚Äì so hang on in there.
